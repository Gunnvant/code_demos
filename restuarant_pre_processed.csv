The staff are extremely friendly, the music is great, and the food never fails to keep me satisfied and excited for the next time I get to place an order! And as a college student, I am totally happy to pay six bucks for a satisfying half order of noodles, not including awesome happy hour specials.

I am a religious noodle orderer. My favorites being the Short Rib Ramen and the Clam Chowder Udon. That being said, Noodle Cat always blows me away with their daily specials! Just when I think they've outdone themselves, along comes another brilliant flavor combination posted daily to the restaurant website.

When I don't order noodles to-go for lunch and instead drag a friend with me for dinner in the hopes of converting them too, the pork chop entree with kimchee apples and fried sticky rice is amazing. And friends are continuously, and pleasantly, surprised with how simply but delicious the menu options are here. 

Such a huge fan of Noodle Cat's attitude of loyalty to green and local products! Like their delicious house infused sake creations. 

All the more reason to support a Cleveland food establishment like this one.

12,_6hReDyVSr94W2WMO1LJLw,4,"I enjoy The Root Cafe in general, and have been enjoying it since soon after moving here in May 2011. I found out about the place through a cop. I was shopping or something in Lakewood and figured if anyone knew where the good coffee was in a particular area, it would be a police officer. I asked an officer who was standing around the stores where the best coffee in Lakewood could be found, and he directed me to The Root Cafe. Originally he directed me toward a fancy kind of coffee, I was thinking, because of the way he described this special filter for the coffee--a cone-like object that some people will be familiar with or know what I'm talking about--like the thing that you put the coffee filter in on a coffee maker. Not a french press but a more regular-looking thing. Anyway it turned out when I went to The Root Cafe and asked one of the employees about which kind of coffee the cop might have been describing that was so good, she told me he meant just their regular coffee--less expensive than the kind prepared using the special filter thing I described before. So I got a cup of regular. Indeed it was good coffee. Not necessarily the best, but good. 

I also enjoy the food at The Root. They have delicious molasses cookies, and the vegetarian dishes--they are all vegetarian--are satisfying enough that one might think there was some meat/protein-based item snuck into their sandwiches. After I eat something there, I am full.  

The only downside to this place is if you want to have an audible conversation and you go at one of the times of the week when they have a band.

I was unsure of which kind of steak I wanted, but our server was very knowledgeable and steered (ha) me toward the sirloin cut, assuring me that it would be tender so long as I didn't want it well done. I was very pleased to hear that they knew how to cook a steak ""Pittsburgh rare"".
My husband and I ordered the exact same thing: sirloin cut with potatoes and caesar salads. The salad had a bit too much dressing, but that's fine. I'm not there for the vegetables.
Our steaks arrived in a timely fashion and were absolutely PERFECT! My husband and I were very happy with our meals and overall experience.
The service and timing of everything was great, and the manager even stopped by to make sure all was well. 
My only reason for giving 4 stars is because I had to ask for the bread and butter, when I was under the impression that it's supposed to arrive with the drinks or salads. Not a huge deal, but that bread is delicious.

The Brother's Burrito with chicken though!? Out of this world good.

I hate to compare Chiptole but it's like, you kinda have to. So, sorry Chipotle. 

Chipotle has never been a favorite of mine. When everyone was delcaring Chipotle the best Mexican food they've ever had, I wanted to sling shot myself into outerspace because who wants to live on a planet where people believe that?

I came to OCB not really expecting something to blow me away but oooh it did. I'm a big cheese fan and I always order extra cheese on everything (yeah, I know it's unhealthy. Big whoop, wanna fight about it?). The cheese in my Brother's chicken burrito was so very delicious - I don't know what the difference is (maybe having two cheeses is a factor) but boy is it gooood! The chips were phenom too as well as my gauc. Nice and lumpy with NO CRUNCHY NASTY ONIONS in the mix! 

I ate half my burrito and took the rest to go. Then got home a few hours later and ate the rest! No leftovers for tomorrow, sadly.

The place is so very quaint, well decorated with a Mexican theme (duh) and the employees were nice (and they were quick which is muy importante!!)

The only thing I was disappointed in was the Horchata. It tasted more like Hornada. Bleh! It was like drinking cinnamon water, no ma'am!

69,zzSYBWuv_fXGtSgsO-6_1g,4,"I was craving Vietnamese food today (yet again) so I decided to try someplace closer than 31st & Superior.

Firstly, I'll say that the woman who took my order over the phone was very nice. Bowl of Pho is also nice on the inside but I ordered my food to go so I can't really comment on their waitstaff.

Since everyone, their mothers and their grandmothers praise Superior Pho and pretty much claims everywhere else is mediocre (at best), I wasn't really hoping for the best. I was just hoping it was edible.

I ordered 2 orders of spring rolls, bubble tea (strawberry), fried rice (chicken), and deluxe beef noodle.

The bubble tea, while good, tasted... odd but not in a bad way though. It was very sweet and it tasted like a red licorice shake. O.o

Luckily, I love red licorice. But it definitely didn't taste like strawberry, not even remotely. The tapioca pearls were good too and in my opinion, they were better than *gasp* the ones at Superior Pho.

The food was pretty good too. The pho (which was my main dish) was terrific with a multitude of flavors and spices that hit the palate just right. Nice amounts of meat (not an overabundance but not super shady either). I had my food to-go so when I got home, I put in the the meat, sides and noodles which, because I'm  assuming they don't rinse off their noodles, were super starchy and was kinda congealed to the styrofoam to-go container. However, after me breaking it up a bit and placing them into the pho, they broke up a little bit so it wasn't just clumps of ramen sitting at the bottom of my bowl.

The chicken fried rice my husband ordered was really good.

The spring rolls were good as were the sauce but I have to admit that Superior Pho is well, superior with their spring rolls and the sauce (oh dear God, their sauccceeee!!).

All in all, I came in not expecting much and now I'm full of delicious food and a new Vietnamese spot to eat at when I don't want to trek all the way downtown.

On a recent visit to Cleveland, we made it to Melt, which was made known to us by Man V. Food. The place was packed- we put our name in and waited with about 30 others for a table. We figured we could be really efficient if we looked at the menu so that we knew exactly what to order, but it wasn't that easy. Everything on the menu sounded so good that 60-90 min after I thought i had made up my mind, I was tongue-tied when the waiter asked what i wanted to order. I made a quick decision, and ordered the Westside Monte Cristo. It was probably one of the best last-minute decisions i ever made. This gourmet grilled cheese sandwich had ham, turkey, swiss and american cheese between 2 thick slices of white bread that was then beer-battered and deep fried. YUM. To top it off, they give you a side of berry preserves for the perfect combination of sweet and salty and chewy and crunchy.

It was my first time having the dish, and while I didn't exactly know what to expect, I definitely didn't think it'd be so fancy. I think that historically, the dish was typically made from scraps as cheap comfort food, but The South Side puts their own spin on it. At The South Side, they serve a Belgian waffle that is accompanied by a meaty piece of fried white chicken and topped off with a generous slab of cinnamon laced butter. The maple syrup isn't too sweet, in fact, we were told that it's made with agave for a lighter taste. It also comes with a side of sriracha for those that like their food with a little spice. The combination of the cinnamon buttered waffle, greasy chicken, maple syrup and sriracha may sound unusual, but one bite stimulated so many different taste buds that it actually created a heavenly mix of salty, sweet, and spicy. How all those flavors can come together to be so delicious still boggles my mind. 
While this review was mostly for the chicken and waffles, I will briefly mention that the other dishes ordered were prepared just as well with quality ingredients for an average of $15(+) a person.

The best part was the garlic piada that comes with the pasta or the salad.  It reminded me of Naan, which I LOVE and I love garlic naan, so already liking it.  IT'S FULL OF CHEESE!    I am an unabashed cheese freak (you can never have too much cheese or chocolate).

The boyfriend and I, with my 12 and 10 year old ""nieces"" in tow, stopped for lunch after having been at the science center.   I had looked up and printed the menu.   Little surprises with the prices ( little higher than expected and the menu I printed did not say that pancakes are only served until 11 a.m. so some confusion.)  My ""nieces"" had to be meatless since it was Friday during Lent, so the boyfriend was a good sport and ordered the hummus wrap sans chicken so as not to taunt the girls. I had the artichoke dip, my 10 year old mac and cheese freak (just like her Aunt:) ) had the side of mac and the 12 year old had eggs with home fries.   Everything was prompt and hot.  

If Thursday is cruciferous vegetable night, do not order the dip. Just saying that as a personal warning.  Trust me. ( I had sauerkraut the night before....oops.)  So, if you are a risk taker or Thursday is no longer cruciferous vegetable night, then PLEASE  get the dip and take me with you!  Oh my......this is the stuff of dreams.  Dill, cream cheese, feta and whole chunks of artichoke......*drool* sorry, wiping off keyboard... I make a good hot artichoke dip myself, and I thought that was good.  Forget the tasteless wallpaper paste dips from the chain restaurants of the 90's, this is so light and tasty .  Comes with homemade lemon pepper pita chips...if you are sharing, I suggest getting a second side order of chips.  I ran out of chips before dip.  I actually ate half, took half home and go two more snacks (sizeable) out of the rest. 

The mac and cheese was so good! I had to fight to get a taste, but I so want more!   My homemade is still the best, but this is a close second.  According to my other ""niece"" her eggs and home fries were really good.

Full of sports memorabilia and several screens to watch whatever sports event is going on, it is so worth it.  My mom and grandma love the St. Louis ribs and my boyfriend is working his was through all of them.  Me, I go for the mac and cheese.  THE BEST MAC AND CHEESE   I HAVE HAD SO FAR!  I love the fried chicken too.  You can only get half or whole, and I swear they are Dolly Parton chickens!   The breasts are that big.  The deserts are killer too.

Bubba himself works here and will seat, cook, greet, and bus tables , which to me says a lot to this place and that  is that he is not just a name on the door.

They also do catering.  If I ever need a caterer, I'm going with them.

2-20-11 Update:

Not too happy with the place as of the date listed above.  We went  on the 20th to celebrate the boyfriends b-day and it was NOT a 5 star experience!  It was more like a 3, which is NOT normal for the place.  They were out of St. Louis ribs (they were in the smoker), there were no cornbread mini muffins (which it is worth going just for those) and they were out of both Sierra Mist and lemonade, which I find a little hard to believe.  Service left a lot to be desired, and yes they were busy, but I have been there when it has been slammed and had better service.  My mom had the fried chicken and her thigh was under cooked.  My grilled breast was a little dry, but the boyfriend said that his sliders were really good and grandma said the baby backs were very meaty.

A sign was posted looking for experienced help, so that may have been part of the problem.

SERVICE:
- Water refilled water quickly, table cleaned after each course promptly.

- Highly recommend them.
- If most other mussels are prepared well-done, these were medium-rare. Very succulent. Moist. Melts like butter, with waves of ocean.
- Sauce: rich in cream with some spicy note. Very flavorful and complex.

- Interesting dish. Worth getting once.
- Interesting to look at. Big cross-section of bone with jelly-like bone marrow with some greens filling in the middle.
- Served with toasts and pickled veggies.

- Definitely interesting experience. The toast itself is unremarkable.

- Plentiful serving.
- Seasoning: the white creamy sauce with the pickled vegetables were eye-awakening. Tangy and new. Balances the meat very well.

My dinner at Toko's was the best dinner I've had this month. It was better than any other Japanese restaurants I have visited in Ohio over the last four years.

So it is $19.99 all you can eat. Caveat is you can only get 4 slabs of sashimi per person. 

OMG, let me tell you. Those were the best sashimi's I've had in Ohio. When I see other folks just getting california rolls to jam in their stomach pouch, I see lost opportunities. I tried octopus, red hopper, yellow tail, and striped bass. They were all out-of-this-world. I know there's no ocean nearby. But somehow, these sashimi's were absolute, lethal killers. Mellow you out, put you through nirvana. I didn't want to use soy sauce, it was that good. 

Likewise, sushis were also very good. I really liked eel, egg, & yellow tail.

The boss part about this is you can order so many different appetizers! And my goodness... The scallop pancake, holy moly! It is so chewy, and full of flavor. Beer nariyaki (something like that?). Just really neat, full of flavor, but really thoughtfully packaged.

They had it all for me. Lean food, with such great flavors in sashimi and appetizer. Even the rolls (I got eel w/ avocado) was not one of those giant, tons of mayo-based sauce, in your face decoration. It was modest but, man those flavors!!!!

as advertised, beef pierogi was awesome. it has many different flavor in ways that you don't experience everyday. it is ""the difference"" you expect when you commit yourself (financially) for a fine dining. For entree, I tried the two pork dish: pork chop and the quail & pork belly. Pork chop doesn't have too many different flavors; it's mostly the pork chop and grits, but the flavor is very rich; it's one of those things you just describe as ""damn good."" For me personally, it wasn't quiet the ""blew me away"" fine dining entree i hoped it would be. Pork belly was okay, while the quail was a bit salty but very flavorful; the side vegetables had refreshing and sour flavor and turned out to be my favorite part about this dish.

overall, i really liked beef pierogi, but was not blown away by the pork dish. between the two pork dish, i'd recommend the pork chop. and i wish i never ordered the $8 wood chuck.",1298,0.10776987776349717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8922301222365029,"reservation,restaurant,waiter,merchant,wine,desert,waiters,ipad,drinks,menu,fancy,plum,beer,wood,chuck,self,dollar,sign,beef,pierogi,flavor,ways,difference,dining,entree,pork,dish,chop,quail,belly,flavors,grits,things,bit,side,vegetables,part","wine,drinks,beef,vegetables",part

143,__rNL7RODe1D85sWuU-FKg,4,"We walked in to have breakfast here for the first time today, and as I checked out yelp, I was intrigued by the mixed reviews. This was an 8AM breakfast on a weekday and when we walked in, the place was almost empty. We had a pleasant and engaging server who had a natural rapport about him. We find out this place gets pretty much mobbed on weekday lunch and on breakfast weekend hours.

The breakfast was great. I ordered the classic bacon and eggs breakfast they had at the top of the menu, which I would recommend. The tastiest part of this breakfast was the potato hash because they used whole, mini b-potatoes with skin seared to a crunchy potato-chip-like texture that tasted pleasantly onion-y, garlicky and herb-y . Hash potatoes sometimes suffer from sogginess -- not his one. Bacon was thick cut, which was another plus. My s/o ordered the deliciously fluffy pancakes on a thankfully-not-too-sweet cherry reduction.

The price of $35 for 2 people, to me, for the quality of what we ate, was way more than fair. If you want to go any lower on the price point, then you'd have to skip on a few wonderful ingredient details (like whole fresh potatoes, art on your latte, home-made cherry sauce, fresh berries, home-made sourdough) and will basically translate to a place like Bob Evans. Price it any higher -- then we're talking brunch at Fire where more twists ergo, pricier ingredients, are to be expected.

I love the architecture and the nostalgia-inducing interior. Diners like this were prevalent at a time of American optimism and wonder. Sadly, along with American optimism, there's only a few of them left these days. Finally, a few theories on why I think there are mixed reviews: (1) when this place gets too crowded, the added task and time pressure might affect service (2) too-high expectations for the Katz name? maybe.

146,udFcIcbWbxrO8uLF95WnQg,5,"Located in Cleveland's historic (and newly redecorated) theater district, this is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland.

Do specify to the server that you are watching a show so they are aware. I also recommend a good 1.5-2hours to show up at this place before the show.

This is a great place to bring a group. It is one of Zack Bruell's restaurants that feature new-american dishes with a heavy French influence as opposed to the more traditional-leaning french served in L'Albatross (another favorite).

This is the place to go if you love savory dishes, but not the place to go if you are on a fat-free diet! This restaurant specializes in guilty pleasures.

Among the top foods to try:

1. Gravy frites or Animal frites. Decadent. Poutine basically. French fries fried in duck fat. Gravy and cheese curds. If that's not enough, you can opt for the animal frites that would add fried eggs and bacon. Fries somehow taste good, but something magical happens when combined with cheese, we all know that. But the addition of gravy or egg or bacon however; places this dish in my short list for ""last meal on earth"" if I was on death row. Not advisable if you have a heart condition, unless of course, you indeed are on death row.

2. Chicken wings confit. This is different from your typical fried wing. If braised in oil like they would a duck confit, then you can imagine that the meat will end up flaky and fall-off-the-bone tender, with fat all well rendered (with the typical wing, I find these gross pockets of whole undercooked fat in the wing that I find unappealing -- not this one), and crispy -- almost like pork rinds (I hate soggy wings, they remind me of tyson microwave products). The sauce it was tossed in, has acidity and a lot of garlic that cuts through the wing. This is my absolute favorite chicken wing dish.

3. Pork chop saltimboca. This is not just a pork chop, although not explicitly stated, there's a bit of pork belly in there. This pork chop has it all, great flavors, tender sweat meat and fat content that is well-rendered. I used the term ""rendered"" a lot -- basically fat that is not rendered is solid, dense and gross.

The duck confit appetizer was equally impressive, and much like the pork belly, fat was rendered excellently, skin crispy, and the meat fell right off the bone. The trout fulfilled my requirements of the dish: the skin had a good pan-sear, yet was juicy but not soggy on the inside. It was served hot on top of grits and kale. These dishes get a 5.

The croque madam was warm, comforting and oh boy, larger-than-expected. It would taste like a ham and cheese sandwich with egg on top. The bread tasted like a sourdough that tasted even better when that sunny-side-up egg broke all over it. This is an easy dish I can make at home though. Pork schnitzel was a decent dish, basically your German version of an American breaded pork chop or Japanese pork Tonkatsu if you will. There was an egg on top that took it to a higher level. It was well cooked, but I personally think it's challenging to get more ""wow"" out of a breaded pork cutlet, not much to say. These dishes get a 4.

I walk in and automatically love the ambiance. Located in Little Italy, along a cobbled road, in a university neighborhood; the shop itself is a refurbished home that on the inside looks like a New York loft.

If Folger's coffee is first wave, and Starbucks is second wave, then Rising Star is among the third wave of coffee shops that offer sophistication and opulence at a step above. For lattes, they offered me two blends: a mellow blend and a lively blend. I took the mellow blend and hands down, it was among the best cups of Joe I've ever had in Cleveland; rich, creamy, nutty, complex and flavorful.

For many years, Europeans, Italians in particular, have made fun of the American taste for watered-down coffee. In fact, the name ""Cafe Americano"" came to be, because this is what they had to serve American GIs in WW2 to cater to that preference. With Cleveland gems like Rising Star, Pour and Phoenix; we have something that serious coffee lovers can savor, and that might rival the stuff they serve across the pond, and at way less than the overpriced 5 to 10 Euros. It is rather fitting that this shop finally took root in Little Italy.

167,APPZiUz_CEvR_--qY-tbig,4,"How can one tell if sushi is the real deal and fresh? For one, tuna should be a bright red and translucent, like how red gelatin looks like. The consistency of fresh sashimi should be firm but not spongy. Fresh salmon, should glisten more. As a rule, the duller the color, the more spongy consistency; the lower the quality. Cleveland suffers from being far from the ocean. Sushi suffers a bit especially in the winter months.

With all that criteria laid out, and having had sushi in Asia as a frame of reference; Pacific East and Shuhei; have the freshest sashimi-grade fish one can find in Cleveland. I order sashimi in places like this. In lesser places I go for rolls and drown it in the sauces to compensate - not here. Sushi rock is good too -- but the quality is the same as Pacific East but at a much higher price. All the good places use authentic short-grain Japanese rice -- watch out for places that try to pull a fast one with substitutes to this kind of rice.

One of my favorite non-sushi dishes is Unagi Don and Shrimp tempura.

Their shepherd's pie and fish and chips are both fantastic and priced very reasonably ($12.95 and $13.50 respectively). They excel at their British/Irish dishes, I can't really comment on anything else. The shepherd's pie is probably my favorite. The meat is very high quality and their mashed potatoes are great. They bake it so that it's just lightly brown on top. Looks and tastes great. Their fish and chips, they give an enormous amount of fries, enough for two people. At least you can have leftovers to heat in the oven later. The fish is crispy on the outside as it should be and you can tell it's a good quality fish.

Their beer selection isn't anything to write home about, but then again, it doesn't try to, it just has your basic Irish beers and some Great Lakes. Nothing to complain about, but if you're looking to try a new beer, you probably won't find one here.

The atmosphere is something The Harp excels at in every way. The tables are beautiful. No wobbly tables here, just thick, solid, hard wood.

They introduced me to my now favorite coffee in the world - Van Roy Dark 'n Stormy.
 I picked it up on a whim, my mind was seriously blown when I tried it at home.

They also have the excellent Uncle Mike's beef jerky, my favorite beef jerky and it's made right here in Ohio. Nathan's Horseradish Pickles are another excellent made in Ohio product they have.

We ordered the margherita pizza and the shrimp pizza and both were fantastic. I've also had the lardo pizza, which is actually my favorite.

If you want an import or craft beer, it can be up to $5 (which really isn't bad at all). From what I understand, well drinks are $2 but top-shelf stuff will cost you a little more.

LIKES:
- Great buffet selection
- Up to one pound you can get it for $6.99
- I got quite full from spending $5 today 
- Very delicious savory foods
- Great location across from CSU

DISLIKES
- Portions on non-buffet menu items are ridiculously tiny
- Customer service is hit or miss. Ive been there five times now and the service was great three times, once was so-so and another time I had to ask to be served
- The slush flavor I had (strawberry) reminded me of robitussin. Disgusting and threw it away.

I ordered one of the best dishes I've had in CLE in a while. Period. The twice cooked pork. It was downright succulent, served with cabbage and other veggies. It had a saltiness and a slight spice that suited it well. It was served with a side of rice.

My bf opted for the boiled beef, a house specialty. He has a much higher tolerance for spice than I, so he loved it. It came in a hot pot with various spices and veggies. I tried one bite and my tongue became overwhelmed by heat. It was good but hellsa hot. Also served with a side of rice.

While visiting Cleveland, I went to Lolita for a late dinner around 9:20pm on a Thursday. I sat at the bar, and there was quite a full crowd because they have a second, late happy hour from 9pm-10pm with great deals on drinks and small plates.

I ordered the house red wine ($4 at happy hour!), and two suggestions of the bartender: the roasted dates to start and the steak entree with a side of brussels sprouts. The dates ($7) were incredibly decadent: roasted and topped with almonds, bacon, chilies and parsley, they are a party in your both of sweet and salty and spicy. The sirloin ($20), which the bartender told me is a new menu item, was beautifully cooked and topped with parmesan, truffle butter, arugula and mushrooms. It was good, although there are other things on the menu that might be more exciting. The STAND OUT dish of the evening was the fried brussels sprouts, which I would very much like the recipe for so I can gorge myself on them every night. Those babies, topped with crispy crumbled bits of anchovy, capers and walnuts, were pure bliss. And let's be honest, how often do you really have the opportunity to call brussles sprouts blissful?

342,k-XN0KuOWPU5xZlfXOVSlA,5,"I am SO glad that I discovered Ninja City at the Cleveland Night Market this July where they had a booth. I tried the Spicy Shrimp Quesadilla, and WOW, I was so happy to find that it actually has a nice kick to it, perfectly complimented by the sweetness of the mango salsa! This yummy ""little bite"" has become a food addiction for me lol that I literally crave. 

Since then, I have visited Ninja City in Uptown many times, both weeknights and on weekend nights, and I have always been impressed with the excellent drinks, delicious food, and the friendly attentive staff -- particularly the great bartenders who always make sure that you have cold water as well as your beverages. Ninja City owner, Dylan, exudes a very appealing natural charm as he smoothly makes his rounds through the house, warmly greeting guests and personally making sure that everyone's needs are met; Dylan always makes you feel like a VIP and he's so glad that you came. It's no surprise that Ninja City has attracted many regular patrons, including me!

Ninja City's industrial/super-hero theme decor is genius, and the whole vibe is hip, casual, fun and always very welcoming! Also worth mentioning, the spacious ladies room is especially nice with its cool graffiti wall and full length mirror; it is always immaculately clean, too. And if you are still playing Pokemon Go, Ninja City is a pokestop!

I usually order from the Little Bites menu -- in addition to the above mentioned quesadilla, I also recommend the Shrimp Buns (spicy!), Garlic Wings, Spring Rolls, and Sweet Potato Tempura Fries. On my most recent visit, I tried the Korean Rice Bowl - beautiful presentation and the flavor combination was spot on; it contained a very generous amount of tender, perfectly seasoned beef and some of the best kimchi I've had. I'm an omnivore, but if you are vegan or vegetarian (like my sister), no worries, they have that covered. When you come for dinner, try to save room for dessert -- the Fried Icecream with fruit and whipped cream is truly to die for. If you just want to drink and chill, I highly recommend their weekend events (Fresh Friday, Uptown Saturday Nights) when they feature sick DJs spinning hip-hop all night.

This a small, narrow venue with a few tables up front, tables on one wall and a bar with seating on the other wall. The place was packed but luckily there was a table for two available, where I was promptly seated. Reservations are probably a good idea. 

We asked for an amazing sounding entree special (seafood chowder) split as an appetizer and it was no problem. In fact the server commented that it was a great call. This rich, hearty chowder was literally the perfect way to warm up on a cold winter night. They seriously need to add this to the permanent menu, or at least keep it seasonally -- I want it again!

Next we had the Spicy Soppressata pizza. This was very good, topped with lots of fresh banana peppers and cheese, and a tasty crust. The size was ideal for two people to share along with the appetizer. No room for dessert this time!

For starters, we had the Ddaek Bok Gi. It is a favorite standard and this was as good as I've had. We also had a spicy tofu soup that was so satisfying on a chilly night. 

My date recommended the beef BBQ, which he cooked for us on a grill they brought to our table. The first grill wasn't cooking properly, and the staff noticed immediately and replaced it without us even asking. The beef was thinly sliced and delicious. It is served with large lettuce leaves and rice to make wraps. The dipping sauces were excellent; I cant' decide which I preferred. Of course, we had an array of Korean sides, and these were all very tasty as well. We also had the egg custard which was creamy and delicious.

As a side note, the waiter was very polite, attentive, and adorably cute! I felt like we were in a kdrama restaurant scene, and they had cast an idol to be our server lol. He reminded me of Baekyun from EXO. (Sadly, our waiter claimed that he cannot sing. Yes, I asked heehee)

We drank quite a lot of soju, mostly because my date's friends (who happened to be there  dining too) thought it was cute to send it over to our table. So just know that if you get a bit too happy and decide to turn the parking lot into an outdoor dance floor with your car stereo blaring, someone will call the police.

We went on a whim that day and there were no tours to be had! So this is strictly a review of the restaurant. If it is any indication of the quality of the brewery, I will definitely have to visit again!

Make your way to the rustic GLBC and you'll find that it has the tried and true tavern feeling to it. The dining area is somewhat small but nicely arranged with an ample amount of lighting and tasteful decor. You'll be surrounded by wooden fixtures and brewing equipment that adds to the cozy ambiance. You want warm, heart-touching food? The setting is right!

The service is also friendly. We had a knowledgeable waiter who wasn't afraid to make some small recommendations. I'm a fan of GLBC brews so I wanted to know what could be had at the source. The TAP menu presented all the favorites and some specialties. I usually go with ales, but I couldn't resist the Blackout Stout, with a high ABV, it is smooth and delicious-- complete with chocolatey undertones. The Christmas Ale is always good too, especially fresh.

The food, is on point. It's hard to say with so much variety in the menu but the Killbuck Valley Mushroom pizza was perfect to be split by two. The Alder Kase bleu cheese jumps out and kicks you in the face while the garlic oil nurtures and soothes the pain that is so good. You'll want to finish it, but then you can't have some later?

Get inside and be seated in this place that looks like a cross between a banquet hall and a diner. Simple, yet sophisticated. The menu is absolutely inviting and clear to read. If you check out their website, the menus are essentially scans of what you'll see in the restaurant.

Responsibility is what earns the fourth star. The waitress was very informed and accommodating in service.

The wife got the regular Döner plate, and the couple also got that to share. I think that each of us were impressed with our order.  For dessert, we tried the chocolate mousse.

My first trip about a year ago was not so great as I had a small meal before meeting up with friends there on the spur of the moment. Going to Melt is all about planning. Now, the wife and I will decide on the sandwich we want and only order one. This is key. I have tried many times to finish a whole one on my own, and have failed miserably each time.  SHARE.  We also order the house salad with house dressing. I was really impressed by it the first time I ordered it, and have gotten it each time since.  The tangy bleu cheese and the sweetness of the dressing, really make for a unique salad that I wish I could replicate at home. We usually try different craft sodas when we go and have not come away disappointed. The ambiance is great, typical bar, but they always have on great TV channels ranging from sports, to Boomerang and Cartoon Network. If there was one aspect that I would choose to be a little disappointed with, it would be the service. We've never had a truly terrible server, but usually things just seem a little hectic.  Trying to flag someone down for a refill or condiment can be a challenge at times. That being said, going to Melt is definitely an experience that everyone should have!

The restaurant itself is very nice and clean inside.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  Service is quick - you'll get your big piping hot bowl of pho shortly after you order.  The pho comes with a huge plate of all of the traditional fixings - lime wedges, jalapeno slices, cilantro, bean sprouts and Thai basil.  Sriracha, hoisin sauce and other condiments are already on the table.

The broth is savory and perfect.  The meat is sliced thin and is always tender.  The bowls are loaded with noodles.  I have been here many times and I have never had a bad experience here.  They are always consistent with their food.

They have bahn mi, too, along with some other Vietnamese dishes and ""appetizers"" like spring rolls and summer rolls.  I love their pho too much to venture out and try anything else here, but I have had friends order said above items and they had nothing but great things to say about them.

397,1YGQsn4AHPbcVsRmHqbeqQ,4,"This is the only B Spot location I have been to.

I ordered the cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, onion & cheddar cheese. You have to order fries and onion rings separately so it can get kind of pricey.  A meal for four (four burgers, including the Lola and Yo!) and one order of fries + two sodas ended up being more than $50.  That's pretty damn expensive.

Anyway, back to the Cheezburger.  The burgers are smaller than other burgers I have had but they pile on the ingredients.  Ingredients are fresh.  The burger itself was amazing and cooked perfectly.  The bun is buttered and also grilled so there is a slight crispy crunch as you bite into your burger which I love.  Everybody else loved their burgers, too.

The fries are also delicious.  I guess the owner Michael Symon is known for them.  They're matchstick style fries with rosemary.  The fries weren't overly seasoned which was good (nothing like ridiculously salty fries!) but you could definitely taste the rosemary.  They weren't too greasy, either.

Finally, we ordered the vanilla bean apple pie bacon milkshake.  OMG.  That itself is a must try!

436,vOY6w1Q45Iod8sy2c8zetg,5,"I am a regular here despite having a ritual of trying a different restaurant every week.  For starters, places like Hyde Park, Flemings, XO and Johnny's are great places to go; and all share in common prime steaks that are tender and heavily marbled. I visit these places.

That said, Red is my favorite steakhouse in Northeast Ohio. Here are my reasons why it stands apart:

(1) they never, never, ever, get the done-ness wrong. very accurate. never over-done. never under-done. just right and always right.

(2) as with other steakhouses, they char the meat in an 1800deg burner. I've had other places over-char and burn the meat leaving a bitter tasting ""crust"". This will never happen here. 

(3) prime cuts already taste buttery and marbled. The staple of most places is to butter the steak or season in salt and pepper. At Red, they apply an ""aglio"" brushing, that I guess is made from olive oil and italian herbs, which does the job of cutting through or counterbalancing that rich beefy-buttery taste of prime meat.

(4) the decor and ambiance is a refreshing departure from the mahogany panel and old-school design of most steakhouses. This place is hip. Background music is electronica instead of jazz. I love jazz, but I love the change-up for this situation. This is not your father's steakhouse.

What else wins here? The truffled mashed potatoes - very different and somewhat earthy and smoky in flavor. It's an absolute favorite. The risotto -- they will have a different kind featured every week but you can have them customize it for you. The potatoes au gratin are good too. The doughnut holes for dessert -- they remind me of the New Orleans beignets from Cafe du Monde.

455,tUjyGFSN8wQqLgKp5Q0CUA,4,"Spend $115 on the Bianco tasting menu and report out my thoughts, insights and feelings about it to fellow yelpers? Someone had to do it, and tonight, I present a review that is somewhat painful to write.

The theme of the Bianco tasting menu is ""an inventive twist on the edible wildlife around us"". The focus of the culinary skill here it seems, is to do what it takes to highlight and frame the flavors of nature, that are by default, a culinary gift unto itself. You won't see heavy sauces or deep fried fare. You will see a gentle approach to: wild mushrooms, the same mushroom essence aged for a year, eggs poached on tree bark charcoal, prawns essences made from the entire prawn, fish roe, rabbit and game. If I was to rename this tasting menu in less sophisticated fashion, I'd call it the ""Forager's Special"" or ""Cleveland Metroparks Special"" -- imagine ""survivalist"" fare turned sophisticated or how Jonathon Sawyer would cook if he was left with nothing but ingredients from the north american wilderness. I think the concept is bold, very forward thinking and also... risky.

Sounds good so far? Here's how the 2-hour, 12-course adventure tasted.

The first plate that came out had these polenta flakes that honestly had the texture of plastic cellophane topped with salted butter. My teeth got a work out from the polenta jerky. In my estimation, each of these chew toys probably set me back 5 bucks each so I had to finish it. With it was this pea-sized morsel of what seemed like beef carpaccio on the side and thin slice of pickled beet. 

What followed next was a literal 1X1 foot block of wood laid on our table topped with exactly two pea-sized portions of some chickpea pastry topped with a single piece of fish roe. It would have been a disaster had I dropped it, so I picked it up carefully and ate it with my eyes closed, but it was so small that it went down my throat like a pill. Well, so much for that. Did they invite us take home the block of wood? Unfortunately not, if yes, it would have been worth it, I could have built a bird house for my back yard.

Then came plate after plate of thin as air, small-as-possible portions of fish, various broths, prawns with what they call ""prawn butter"" made from crushed prawn parts, exactly two oysters, a single piece of mussel wrapped around a single fettuccinni noodle, and a spoonful of mushrooms.

The highlight of the night was this candle made from beef fat that melted and could serve as a dip for the bread. Still starving, they finally came up with the meat, which was rabbit sausage with casing made from it's own gut and a matchbox-sized portion of sirloin (hey, this isn't an exotic item -- why the matchbox size?!?). Then, there was desert, bavarian cake the size of a twinkie followed by a single macaroon, you guessed it, pea-sized.

In comparing this with other $115 meals I've had in my lifetime, this one tasted ""good"". Frivolous, yes. But great? I was struggling to think so and I felt like that kid in ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". But here's the deal though -- do not trust my palate. Point is, I know that to a casual listener, Igor Stravinski, one of classical music's greatest geniuses, would sound unintelligible. Heck, not all rock aficionados can understand the genius behind The Grateful Dead.

Verdict: My taste is likely too undeveloped for this type of food. I'm simple enough to be satisfied with classic fare like duck confit, cassoulet, risotto, or steakhouse steak. This would likely be a 5-star rating for more evolved diners, culinary students or fellow chefs. Sawyer is a chef's chef.

The modern art theme continues into the bar and the small restaurant that happens to be owned by Douglas Katz, the same chef of ""fire food and drink"" fame. There are floor to ceiling windows that give a great view of the outside landscape.

This is not to be confused with Provenance Cafe -- which is next door and it is a food court which I have not tried, yet.

Here's what we ordered: thai calamari for starters, mac and cheese for the kid, pan roasted ohio trout for entree, and ""draadjesvlees"" (beef stew) entree from the dutch-themed specials.

The calamari. This is an example of calamari done right: soft, crunchy, non-greasy and not over-battered. The thai-chili sauce on the side had smoky-sweet flavor that seemed like an asian take on barbecue sauce. Cilantro was mixed in with the calamari.

I'm a big fan of trout. I love trout with the skin on. They did just that. The skin was seared -- even better. I love trout because, among most fish, it can easily take on a smoky flavor. It was served hot. The lentils on the side provided a great balance.

The draadjesvlees was beef stew, braised right. Slow-cooked, maybe with a hint of red wine as far as I could tell -- just a guess, but the result was juicy and tender comfort food perfect for that winter afternoon!

477,yhovpO3qCb4QaKT7Xm_rqw,4,"My 16yo son and I recently re located to the northeast Ohio area. So all the local restaurants and businesses are an Adventure for us. I found this location from a review another yelper had posted.

We arrived at the restaurant about 6:03 p.m.  Wednesday and was greeted with live jazz music being played on the patio. We were surprised and ecstatic to be seated within a few minutes in the patio area. 

The ambience , cleanliness, and décor were absolutely superb.  

Negatives-
Slow server responses. Many times she disappeared for several minutes without checking in. My son complained multiple times that he needed refills and service. It was 12 to 15 minutes between service checkins on two occasions.

Menu lacked thorough descriptions and preparation details.

We ordered the  artichoke and spinach dip because that's what we try everywhere we go. My son was not a fan of the light flaky pita chips that came with the dish but I found them a great contrast to the heavy cream of the dip.

For my entree i ordered the lobster flatbread.  My son ordered the California walnut salad with Grilled chicken added.

The menu was not clear on the preparation of the flat bread so I was not expecting the cold, steamed lobster I received. The combination of the sauce and lobster did not provide a favorable aroma or look appetizing. I didn't want to try the dish but did. I did not like it at all. 

In contrast my son loved the grilled chicken California spinach walnut salad with a raspberry vinegarette. He gave me a taste and it was wonderful and fresh.

I ordered a glass of wine while enjoying the music and sent back the lobster dish in exchange for Pasta with shrimp . The pasta was cooked to al dente perfection and the shrimp weri e grilled just right!! 

For dessert my son ordered a 5 layer chocolate mousse cake. See picture for drools !!  :-)

It was a great experience overall. The kitchen was kind in accepting the return of my 1st entree selection. The artist performing was very talented and played no less than 6 different instruments himself and sang. 

Our total bill was around $85 with an 18% tip. I usually always give 22 of 25% but could not bring myself to do so with the inattentive service we received.",2230,0.06985877199474079,0.006503644808981485,0.1954065618637612,0.0,0.0,0.7282310213325165,"son,area,restaurants,businesses,location,review,yelper,restaurant,p.m.,jazz,music,patio,minutes,ambience,cleanliness,server,responses,times,refills,service,checkins,occasions,descriptions,preparation,details,artichoke,spinach,dip,fan,pita,chips,dish,contrast,cream,entree,lobster,flatbread,walnut,salad,chicken,menu,bread,combination,sauce,aroma,raspberry,vinegarette,taste,glass,wine,exchange,shrimp,pasta,dente,perfection,weri,dessert,layer,chocolate,mousse,cake,picture,drools,experience,kitchen,return,selection,artist,performing,instruments,bill,%,tip","restaurants,chicken,bread,wine,kitchen","businesses,times,service,experience"

My fiancé and I come here regularly for the happy hour and to grab a bite to eat.  We have tried almost every dish on the happy hour menu, except for the two seafood selections, and have enjoyed them all.  The duck burger sliders are delicious and well seasoned.  The grilled flatbread with arugula pesto and a fried egg is very good, too.  Our favorite happy hour dish is the spicy soba noodles.  They're extremely spicy and go well with an IPA.  They also make excellent burgers, fries, pasta, and a variety of other dishes.  After your meal you have to try the tiramisu.  It is possibly the best tiramisu I have tasted in my life.  We have never been disappointed with anything we have ordered from either the happy hour or regular menu.

The beer, wine, and booze selection is a dream.  They have a rotating selection of good beers on tap.  The variety often includes at least one IPA, a dark beer, and some sort of barleywine or strong beer.  The Grovewood has a nice range of booze and they make an excellent margarita.

The staff are friendly and attentive.  Once you have been in the Grovewood a few times they will know your name, where you like to sit, and what you like to drink.  The friendly staff and owners are knowledgable about the food, wine, and beer.  I think the staff may be the best part about the Grovewood, if not a close second behind the tiramisu.

Street parking is easy in the area for people who are coming from across town.

Also, I can't help but noticing when reading other people's reviews how much the word ghetto comes up.

We got to Tomo at around 3:15...it was dead in there so they were able to get us a table when we arrived.

The food was incredible!  We got asparagus rolls which were fantastic, then the hibachi entrees included sumashi soup, a salad, then the chef came and cooked our meal.
 
The chef was beyond hilarious, he came out singing early 2000s pop songs to us (completely unexpected).  Made us crack up on more than on occassion.  Had the food ready in 15 minutes, but you dont even realize it was that quickly because your mesmorized by the show.

We walked in and I was SHOCKED at the decor.  I didn't expect there to be a second story balcony ala New Orleans.  Loved the gas lamps at each table and the woodwork was beautiful.

Drinks:  I had a hurricane, it was tasty.  Not Pat O'Briens, but still great!  Love that Abita beer was served, can't go wrong with a TurboDog!

Husband got a crab cake and loved it. I got the gumbo, which was good, but not quite what ""I"" would call a gumbo.  

Hubs got Shrimp and Grits which were extremely tasty.  Expected the shrimp to be head on and bigger, so that was a bit of a disappointment.  I ordered the Cochon De Lait and was VERY happy.  Got fries on the side, those were boring and not that great for the additional $2.50 I was charged.

Now for the bad part.  We ordered beignets.  One was raw inside and they were very dense.  Not at all the kind of begniets I am used to.  I would NOT recommend those.  Also, why aren't Banana's Fosters on the menu?!!?

What is Happy Dog?  It's a neighborhood bar that serves hot dogs and fries.  It puts pretty much anything on the dogs that you could think of.  A variety of cheeses and veggies, goofy items like lucky charms, blue cheese coleslaw, pickles, chili, kraut, condiments...
You sit at the bar (or a table if that's your style) and they give you a checklist like in a sushi place.  You pick out how you want your dog and give the server the slip.  Now enjoy a beer while you wait for your food.
Oh, you only gave them one slip?  What's wrong with you!!!!! Get off your butt and fill out another slip!  You can't just try one crazy dog!  Expand your horizons and your waistline and get no less than two awesome happy dogs!!!

The restaurant is bright and welcoming with a lot of windows that look out on Detroit Avenue. It's a ""counter service, bring food to table"" type of restaurant, so diners must order at the desk in back of the restaurant and wait at the tables for food. My breakfast companion and I were the first ones in the door at 8:00 AM, and he tells me that they do get very busy, especially on the weekends.

We both ordered the Menage a Trois breakfast which is a steal for $4.95 and includes eggs, bacon, sausage made in house, home fries, toast, and coffee. I added a piece of french toast which was more like a cinnamon roll (but delicious) for $2 more. The coffee is unlimited and self-serve and there were two flavors available. Everything was delicious and I highly recommend this place!

668,Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w,5,"In reading these reviews, I feel like it's my duty to champion the Siam Café. We've had a very intimate relationship over the years. Many sit-ups were done in the name of the Siam Cafe. 

When it is my birthday, when I come into town, when it's Mother's or Father's Day, after church when all the other places are closed, when I got dumped, when at the stage of a relationship and I wanted to see the unnatural limits of how much a human body could consume, I went to the Siam Café. 

There are multiple waiters that I have seen come and go, but there is only one that you will ever want. He's a tall Asian man with the skinniest looking, drawn in moustache you'll ever see. The man is a matradee.

Don't order fried rice, noodles, lo mein, or anything that you have ever ordered at a Panda Express. If that's what you want, stay there, but here in the Siam Café, be bold and take chances with your diet: the clams in black bean sauce, the boiled chicken, seafood platter, the wonton soup, and the beef tenderloin.

I won't argue that the place will get busy, but like others said, they are catering to parties of ten or more. Don't be shy here. Raise your hand or yell out for a waiter. If the staff doesn't get to you, the hostess or host will find you. Rarely do I ever see anyone simply standing around here. 

""Long in the tooth?"" An expression that is such a telling statement on itself. The place was a converted family restaurant and not too much has changed but I don't go there for the atmosphere. I go there for the food. It's my hopes that anyone who goes there goes for that single purpose.

The Siam Café is the place to take your loved ones and if you have love great food. If you ever need a recommendation here, feel free to message me. I am the Siam Café's People's Champ.

It really is a home. Not in that drunken Barney, The Simpson's, type of fashion. In that Norm and Clifford type of way, but to think of it - I'm not sure if that is an improvement.

- Hey try this new beer.

- Why thank you. Of course I will accept a tasting of free beer.

The layout is pretty impressive. There's an upstairs for dining. There is also another section for dining on the main floor, plus a pub. Next door is ""The Beer Garden,"" which is an outside dining area that can be enclosed - with a fire place. Then there's a downstairs area, which is more like a English Pub.

670,lcd71KXyEdFjGzWdqH3tAw,4,"An old high school friend and I reconnected. The last time she was in San Diego, we had sushi, so when I rolled into town for the holidays, it was time to have sushi in Cleveland. She recommended a place that had just opened and I knew of the area. It was in Parma. Parma? Yes, Parma. Parma? I invited my roommate, another common friend of ours from high school that had never had sushi in her life, and friend who is in seminary, who the day before had too much Christmas Ale and puked twice. He's a huggy drunk.

I'll be honest, I had my reservations about the place, especially when I saw their rolls which were small and thin. The only time small and thin is a positive thing is when I'm trying to describe a date. Outside of that, small and thin are never positives when referring to penis sizes or sushi rolls. But with that said, I don't rolls or do bento boxes or care for people flipping my food on a grill (I actually have uncles that do that for a living), but what I do care for is sashimi. I simply eat raw fish and let me say, their sashimi quality and price are almost the best I've seen. The pieces are large and you can get an 18 piece of sashimi for around 20 dollars. That is almost unheard of in California. It is easily a 35 to 40 dollar meal here. The cuts are large and flavor was almost artistic. Salmon is my staple, but to my surprise they even had white tuna.

I had bought gloves and shanghaied someone's scarf and wondered what part of spending winter in Cleveland was a good idea. After drinking at the Garage Bar, my friend said, ""I'm hungry."" She and I dumped our friends and texted them to meet us across the street at the ABC Tavern.

I won't go into the 1950 nudes in the back, the bowling machine, the upper area private area, or how my friend and I played ""Can You Spot the Lesbian,"" which I won, because the bi girl I spotted was used as the tie breaker. 

What I will talk about was how my friends and I discovered two key things there. The first one was called Kentucky Bourbon Ale. I stopped drinking Christmas Ale that night (and who was the moron who started this lacing the rim with cinnamon? This is coming from a California guy and we're the ones who shove oranges into our beers), but I've digressed, and made new friends with the Kentucky Bourbon Ale and it gave me its number. I'm waiting three days to call, but I want to call it now. I texted Christmas Ale and said we have to see new people. 

The second thing I discovered there was the Atomic Dog. I was drunk and hungry. If I smoked weed, I can only imagine how much tastier it would be. I even went back the next day sober to see if I was right and you know what, I was. Now close your eyes. Actually don't, you can't read the rest of it if you. Get someone to read the rest to you. Make it your mom. I'll wait.

Still waiting.

All right, close your eyes and imagine the best hot dog that you'll ever taste. It's big and juicy. It is the gayest experience in your mouth next to that one and only time your uncle babysat you and let you drink all those tasty wine coolers all night long.

692,takFPwwTr9Pg3j5xfnb8zw,4,"I have been meaning to check out this sub shop, but was a bit hesitant due to the reviews; people either love this place or hate it. Well, I am so glad I decided to give this place a shot! I drove on into Lakewood and got a parking spot on the street right outside the shop, very convenient. (Also convenient that the Lakewood location is open until 8pm). I strolled on in and was greeted by a personable woman working the front. She was helpful with telling me what the subs were all about and which ones were popular. Since I had just received a coupon in the mail for a buy one get one half off, I decided to take advantage and try two different subs (yeah that's right, both for me!). 

I opted for the West-Sider and the Payne Ave Panini. The West-Sider is a pressed sandwich with smoked turkey, caramelized bacon, chihuahua cheese, relish, lettuce, and a roasted tomato garlic spread. I enjoyed the firmer crust from the sub being pressed, however, it smelled and tasted like they had used peanut oil with the press. The sub was tasty, I was just thrown off with the lingering peanut smell and taste. 

The Payne Ave Panini is kind of like a Bánh mì as it has Asian pork meatballs, relish, cilantro, carrot threads, adobo spread, and lime. This sub was not pressed so the bread was softer and with the moist meatballs and the other ingredients, you are looking at a soggier interior, but it tasted good so I had no problem with that. 

The subs run about $9, but with the coupon my total was $13.50. The subs are also pretty big so you could easily share, put yourself in a food coma, or be like me and have leftovers for the next three days. They also sell bags of chips with flavors like crab or dill, sides of pasta salad (I think, I don't remember), and bottles of root-beer. I do love the logo of a pickle climbing a building, and you get a little side of sliced pickles with every sub order, but here is where I don't give them 5 stars. For a place that is named Cleveland Pickle and makes their own pickles, you would expect them to be pretty great, (aka unique and full of flavor), nope. The pickles do have a nice crunch to them, but the flavor is definitely lacking and unremarkable.

693,bLi48v8Div6Qm2Fyaw0C6Q,4,"So it's Restaurant Week and that just gives me another excuse to meet up with my foodie friends and grab a bite to eat. A fellow Yelper had never been to Hodge's before so we decided to meet up here since you get an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $30 during RW. We showed up early so we could sit at the bar and check out their happy hour menu and started out with some $3 beers and $5 specialty cocktails then added a couple $3-$6 small plates:

-Duck Confit Flatbread: OMG DELICIOUS! I didn't want to share, but I did. One slice.
-Snack Trio: You get one deviled egg which was nothing special, one hankie pankie which is this yummy meat and cheese concoction spread on a crostini, and one devil on horseback which is a bacon wrapped stuffed date which was okay.
-Side of Mac & Cheese: My friend got this and really enjoyed how the figs added a nice touch of sweetness to the dish.  

Later on after we closed out our bar tab we were seated upstairs for dinner. The upstairs is small intimate space overlooking the restaurant below. They have cool artwork on the walls of dictionary pages with screen prints of animals on them. It was 78 degrees up there per the thermostat though, so wear layers you can take off unless you're like my friend who loves it that toasty. Now for the food:

-Cup of Creamy Beer Cheese Soup: Missing the chives, but very good. Perfect balance of beer and cheese that I think would go great over a baked potato or even as a sauce for a pasta dish. 
-Cornbread: Yum! Buttery and slightly sweet with the perfect texture. You could eat it with or without butter or crumble it into your soup. 
-Ohio Chicken: This was my friend's dish, but I tasted it as well and we were both disappointed. The portion was huge, but everything was without flavor and they didn't even eat it. I think it would have been better if they had seasoned the chicken and had a gravy with it instead of the broth it came in. 
-Bay of Fundy Salmon: Looked great, but unfortunately this dish was also disappointing. The fried rice was good, but the salmon was plain and dry. I asked for a side of sauce, but that didn't work either and the dish went uneaten. 
-Chocolate Chip Skillet Cookie: The crust on this was great, nice and crispy. The inside was warm and gooey, but very loaded with chocolate, like a little too much even for me. Cookie went well with the Mitchell's ice cream though and the couple bites I had I enjoyed. Probably would have been better to share unless you're into diabetic comas. 

Management noticed we didn't enjoy our entrees and listened to our remarks when they asked us about our meal. I really appreciate a business that takes the time to see how their guests are enjoying their experience and does what they can to make that experience as best as it can be. They ended up taking financial responsibility for our dinner which was completely unexpected, but such a customer service friendly move that there is no way I can give this place low stars. 

All in all, my friend and I both agreed that we would definitely come back to Hodge's since the small plates and appetizers were great, we'll just stay at the bar next time.",3158,0.2870041901713435,0.03129553492063252,0.12905285897789734,0.0057492602235111115,0.0,0.5468981557066156,"excuse,friends,bite,appetizer,entree,bar,hour,menu,beers,specialty,cocktails,couple,plates,slice,-snack,egg,nothing,hankie,pankie,meat,cheese,concoction,crostini,devil,horseback,bacon,date,-side,friend,figs,touch,sweetness,dish,tab,dinner,upstairs,space,restaurant,artwork,walls,pages,screen,prints,animals,degrees,thermostat,layers,toasty,food,-cup,chives,balance,beer,potato,sauce,pasta,texture,butter,soup,chicken,portion,everything,flavor,gravy,broth,rice,salmon,side,chip,crust,crispy,inside,gooey,chocolate,ice,cream,bites,comas,entrees,remarks,meal,business,time,guests,experience,responsibility,customer,service,move,way,place,stars,appetizers","specialty,meat,food,soup,chicken,rice,meal,business","space,business,time,experience,customer,service,way"

We started with standing at the bar but then moved to a table, luckily though management allowed us to continue with happy hour pricing even though it's usually only offered at the bar. Service was normal, no issues with that. Food is fresh and the menu changes regularly. 

*Chicken Wings - These have fish oil on them. I tried a bite of my friend's order and I did not like it. Weird and salty tasting to me.  
*Buffalo Cauliflower with Blue Cheese Dip $6 - Oh man this was really tasty! And a big enough portion to share. I would definitely get this again!
*Trio of Toasts $7- Three grilled up half slices of bread topped with things like beet hummus, coleslaw and short rib, and cheese with jam and nuts. Simple but good.

695,MX3TL4-ij22rLFBD1XjKGw,5,"Sweet Baby Jesus! What an excellent experience! Fahrenheit was our chosen place for July Supper Club and it did not disappoint! We had 19 guests and I heard not one negative thing.

To start, I had met Chef Rocco at the Chef's Tasting Panel event hosted by Engage Cleveland and he definitely was a huge help in making sure our event turned out great (people get out there and socialize with your local businesses! Connect with your community!). Through his assistant Amber I was able to plan the supper club and have it in the private dining section of the restaurant. We even scored happy hour deals that are usually only available at the bar. So what I am saying is, while I was sent a scary looking contract, I would highly recommend you give management a call because they will definitely work with you and try to meet your needs the best they can. 

Day of we received awesome service from Jill who took great care of us even though we were a large group and everyone was on separate checks (did not mind at all that automatic 20% gratuity added to our bills). There was one older lady who did not seem the most pleasant even though I tried to joke with her, but eh, maybe she just has a standoffish personality or was overwhelmed by our group. We only saw her at the beginning so it was no big deal. 

For food everyone ordered different things from happy hour pizza and tacos, to the Cleveland nachos or grilled avocado for a starter, to fancy short ribs or seared tuna for dinner, and chocolate mouse for dessert. Wine and sangria's were also flowing. Our group was even lucky enough to receive a surprise tasting of cheesesteaks and chicken spring rolls! Yum Yum Yum! 

I personally got the Cleveland nachos $14.75 and it was a HUGE portion and more than plenty to share with the entire group! It's homemade potato chips covered in cheese cause, bacon and scallions. For a main dish I got the Ohio pork shank $30, the pork was tender and you could easily pull it apart. The honey and mascarpone polenta added a sweet touch to balance out the dish. Dessert was the peanut butter tart; basically PB, chocolate, pretzels all fancy. I definitely had leftovers and the dessert took me three days to eat because it was so rich and full of awesome that you were satisfied with only a couple of bites at a time. Oh and my red sangria was good and strong so be prepared! 

Overall we had a fantastic time talking and eating leisurely. We were able to try a variety of dished and I thought this was perfect as most of our group had never been to Fahrenheit before. I know I will definitely be coming back!

Nice atmosphere, not a lot of people inside since it was close to closing time, but the staff quickly greeted me with friendly smiles and they were very informative when I asked about their menu. The food really sounded great, and I did get a bunch of stuff to sample, however the main negatives would be that they seem a bit pricey on some items and the manager repeatedly told me about how they serve Gluten Free items even after I told him I don't care about that. I'm not part of the 2% diagnosed by a medical professional to have a problem with Gluten so stop trying to sell me the latest trend. Now on to the food:

-Pumpkin Tart: Meh, tasted like pumpkin, but nothing special and too dry for me. 
-Chocolate Mousse Cup: Awesome treat for your taste buds. Little pricey at $4 though for the small size. 
-Carrot Cake Cupcake: Eh, good but nothing special. 
-Butternut Squash Salad: Nice and tasty mix of goat cheese, warm bacon dressing, and veggies. 
-Lobster Shrimp Risotto Balls: Deliciousness. Loved soaking up the broth with the risotto balls.

698,qlg2QMEErgseygqs_MQETA,5,"I don't often give out 5 stars on a first visit, but dang! This place really impressed me! Here are the details: I met up with a friend for Saturday morning brunch. They have valet but I just parked on a side street and walked over. Inside decor has this romantic industrial vibe to it, and there is a big window where you can watch what is happening inside the glass blowing workshop next door. (Someone told me that M Italian is a sister restaurant with Burntwood Tavern and the glass shop made all of the glass decor for the restaurants). 

Since we arrived shortly after 11am the place wasn't busy yet and we were seated right away. They have a lovely inside or there is a patio area outside with a bar dividing the two spaces. My only complaint is that it was a hot humid rainy day and they still had the windows/doors open that separate the inside from the outside. This made for a muggy feeling experience. Ordering a frozen peach bellini $9 did help though! It was served in a large glass and was enjoyable.

For food we both decided to get the eggs benedict $14. These aren't your average brunch dishes though! You get two garlic toasts topped with a zucchini and potato hash, two poached eggs, sauce, but you get to choose your meat! I went with a fresh crab cake and my friend chose the salmon filet. You also get a side of mixed fruit. Incredibly tasty meal and it will definitely fill you up! Oh and let's not forget the amazing round loaf of bread they give you as soon as you sit down! Deliciously thick soft warm bread with olive oil to dip it in. 

Our server was pleasant and did her job very well, I think her name was Makenzie? At least that is what the receipt says. My friend and I had a very enjoyable brunch here and I would definitely go back!

Actually, since it's a solid 45 minute drive from where I live I decided to grab dinner to-go (don't judge me, I was already there and decided to take advantage). I went with a caesar salad $6 which came with anchovies. I was going to be brave and try them, but they went in the trash, just not for me. Now the pork tenderloin $14 was excellent! The pork was cooked perfectly and it came with this white bean, asparagus, and red pepper ragout. Mmm so good! They also threw in their tasty bread. I'd like to mention that I ate my dinner the next day so it stood up to being refrigerated and reheated! 

We walked around the cute little Chagrin Falls area afterward. It was an all around good time and I would highly recommend you give them a try! Just a tip, the food tastes great, portion sizes are filling, service pleasant, and atmosphere great for a date, but go during brunch/lunch because the prices are lower so saving money on top of everything else is just going to make you love this place even more.",2779,0.15590966018095595,0.0001724790732605166,0.14418717128248165,0.0,0.16203124985609693,0.537699439607205,"stars,visit,place,details,friend,morning,brunch,street,decor,vibe,window,glass,workshop,door,someone,sister,restaurant,shop,restaurants,area,bar,spaces,complaint,day,windows,doors,inside,outside,feeling,experience,peach,food,eggs,dishes,toasts,zucchini,potato,hash,sauce,meat,crab,cake,salmon,filet,side,fruit,meal,loaf,bread,oil,server,job,name,receipt,minute,drive,dinner,advantage,caesar,salad,anchovies,trash,pork,tenderloin,bean,asparagus,pepper,time,try,tip,portion,sizes,service,pleasant,atmosphere,date,lunch,prices,money,top,everything","restaurants,food,meat,fruit,meal,bread,prices","morning,day,experience,job,time,service"

This time around I finally consulted with the fromager and tasted 5 unique cheeses. Would definitely recommend this experience if you enjoy cheese. Just keep in mind that you eat the cheese plain with only a dollop of honey and fig paste if you'd like, but no crackers to spread the cheese on. (My favorite was this tomme cheese).

We tried the frisée salad, croque monsieur with beans, and the chicken with onion and mashed potatoes. All were very tasty. I do prefer my beans a bit softer, but these were not bad by any means. The croque monsieur took me back to my first trip to France many years ago and I would definitely get it again, the béchamel sauce is a great touch!

They have a lot where you can park for a couple bucks or if you're lucky you can snag free street parking after 6pm.

703,EAiFR299WV3OQ68pHMlmGw,5,"Holy deliciousness! Prayers of thanks to the rice noodle god and his sidekick the eggroll! This will probably be my Asian (Cambodian and Vietnamese) take-out place going forward. I stopped in one afternoon for take-out (don't judge, y'all know by now I'm single and only get through life by comforting myself with a plate of food I didn't have to cook myself), and was greeted by this nice smiley-faced lady behind the counter. She showed me this amazing book filled with pictures of every dish they have! Ahhh I love that! Sometimes I go into a place and I have no idea what the heck something is so the pictures really helped in picking out what to eat. 

I went with the...
*A5 for $11.99 which is several different kinds of rolls: 2 Spring Rolls, 2 Egg Rolls, 2 Rice Paper Rolls, and 5 Mini Spring rolls. The mini rolls were my favorite, nice and crunchy.
*88 for $9.99 which is Banh Sougnh: ""fresh round rice noodles, lettuce, cucumber, bean sprouts, home-made whipped coconut milk, scallions, topped with chopped spring rolls, Asian basil, ground peanuts and stirred lemon grass with our special sauce.""To me it was like a really tasty curry with noodles. 
*98 for $10.98 which is Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt: ""An exotic flavor, mixture of lime leaves, garlic, turmeric root, galanga root, coconut whip, Ma Rass Prowh (special vegetables from Asia) aromatic and fresh lemon grass. Stirred with onion, green or red pepper, chunky chopped roasted peanut with steamed rice and a choice of meat."" This was like a typical rice dish amped up a couple notches. 

For both entrees I got the combination meat (chicken, shrimp, and pork) and asked for mild spiciness. I liked #88 the best, but #98 was still pretty tasty and I am excited to go home and eat it for dinner tonight. Portion sizes are pretty generous/typical of Asian take-out so I got several meals out of my order. I would definitely recommend!

704,7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg,4,"Stopped here for a drink with a friend and decided to get some food to-go. Atmosphere at the bar was nice, very chill with dim lighting but a colorful glow from the holiday lights on the window. The bartender was soft-spoken but no issues with service; she helped me with picking out what food to get, kept our water glasses full, and brought us over some chips and dips to much on while we drank and waited. Some hoppin' Indian music was playing and after a couple more drinks we probably would have started shimmying and shaking. 

As for food:
*Table chips and Dip Free - Very light and crispy with a black pepper flavor. The dip is thin so you gotta let your chip sit for a minute to soak. 
*Chicken Tikka Masala $14.99 - Very saucy. Usually I don't use all of the white rice they give you but with this version you need it. Also note that while some Indian places make this dish with coconut milk, Tandul does not. Large portion so you can definitely share or get a couple meals out of it. 
*Garlic Cheese Naan $4.99 - A bit too soft so I think it could have used another minute or two to cook, but great flavor and perfect for tearing off chunks to scoop up your entree with. 
*Samosa $5.99 - You get three large ones plus a green sauce and a brown sauce. 
*Gobi Manchurian $10.99 - Cauliflower you don't mind eating. 

The food here definitely has some heat to it so be warned, I asked for mild and still thought it was spicy, but I am also a wimp. Portions are generous. Prices seem a little high. But, I enjoyed my food and I am looking forward to leftovers. I will definitely be back to explore more of their menu!

Clean and classy atmosphere with a little bit of cozy with the dimmed lighting. Staff was pleasant and attentive. Our meals started off with some fresh warm bread and butter. Very good, the bread had a nice crust but was soft on the inside. 

-Killer French Dip $17: I love a good french dip and this did not disappoint! Excellent portion size and very tasty! (Broth was a little salty, but whatevs)
-Pan Roasted Salmon $22: This was cooked perfectly! I am not usually a fan of salmon, but I had a couple bites of this, the skin was crispy and the inside was moist and delicious especially with that dill butter. The house mashed potatoes tasted like they had some garlic in them which I enjoyed as well.

Stuffed Peppers - Only two small stuffed peppers, but they were good. 
Stuffed Dates - OMG so delicious, but I wish there was more of them!
Cauliflower Gratin - This was good, but it definitely is heavy. 
Duck Tartine with salad - Brie, fig preserves, duck, YUM! The side salad is very simple with just lettuce though.

710,rzizY1zgiokbRDfD0V_AUw,4,"Stopped by on a Thursday around 8pm and they were all out of meat so I tried again on a Saturday around 12:30pm and success! The manager let me know that I can always call ahead and place an order so that it will be there since lately they have been selling out well before closing time. The building is a little ice cream shack that you walk up to and there are 3 parking spots in front, but there is a lot of parking along the street. The staff does seem to be younger and they didn't come across as very personable (no welcome greeting), but they were nice and helpful when I asked about the menu. You can get your food to-go or you can sit at one of the several picnic tables and enjoy your meal outside. 

I went with...
-The Original Bobo: brisket, coleslaw, pickles, bbq sauce. 
-Lickity Pig: pulled pork glazed with mustard and apple butter, coleslaw, bbq sauce.  
-The Hawaiian Hillbilly: boneless chicken thigh with skin on, pineapple ring, cheddar cheese, bbq sauce.
-Side of Baked Beans.
-Side of Macaroni Salad.  (They switched over from Mac & Cheese but hopefully they bring it back). 

For the food, everything is homemade which I am always a fan of. A word of caution though, you'll definitely need to wash your hands and face after you eat one of these sliders because they are loaded with sauce and are pretty messy. The size of the sliders is actually about the size of a regular sandwich with plenty of meat on them and I think one slider with a side is plenty for a meal to fill you up, but if your stomach can handle two sliders without bursting then the more the merrier! The Hillbilly seemed to actually be made with skinless chicken breast meat, but it was moist and flavorful. The brisket had a big chunk of fat and along with the pulled pork both were on the drier side so slightly chewy, but still flavorful and I liked the touch of black pepper. The Lickity does have this unique cinnamon apple taste to it which I am guessing is from the apple butter?

The sliders are $5 each (max price you can charge for this in my opinion), but I did find a coupon in the mail for buy one get one half off. The sides are $2 each and come in 5 1/2oz containers which does seem a little small, but at $7 for a slider and a side I think it's a decent price for what you're getting; I would not pay more. As for the taste, the baked beans were not bad with a mild chili flavor, pieces of brisket, green peppers, onions and I think I saw three different beans in it. The macaroni salad was pretty standard with green peppers, onions, carrots and a mayo based sauce. Nothing to write home about. 

Overall I would definitely hit this place up again! Maybe next time I'll even try the milkshakes.",2706,0.07343532187867212,0.0372604084288344,0.0,0.06484140837907515,0.02239620488877227,0.8020666564246459,"pm,meat,12:30pm,success,manager,order,time,building,ice,cream,parking,spots,front,lot,street,staff,greeting,menu,food,picnic,tables,meal,brisket,coleslaw,pickles,bbq,sauce,pork,mustard,apple,butter,boneless,chicken,thigh,skin,pineapple,ring,cheddar,cheese,-side,everything,fan,word,caution,hands,sliders,size,sandwich,plenty,slider,side,stomach,merrier,skinless,breast,chunk,fat,touch,pepper,cinnamon,taste,max,price,opinion,coupon,mail,buy,half,sides,oz,containers,beans,flavor,pieces,peppers,onions,macaroni,salad,carrots,mayo,nothing,home,place,milkshakes","meat,food,meal,chicken,home","order,time,building,staff,mail,home"

*Blueberry Waffle Grilled Goat Cheese $9 - Good but would have been great if they added some lemon/zest to the waffle batter and crisped up the waffle some more so it wasn't so soft.  
*Corned Beef Boxty $10 (w/ side of thousand island)- The potato pancakes were delicious, the corned beef was like an ounce though so they definitely skimped on the meat. 
*Bacon $2 - Regular bacon, I think you get 4 strips?
*Broccolini $4 - Nice to have a veggie available so you don't feel as fat eating bread and potatoes. 
*Lamb Meatballs $10.50 - Good, liked the dipping sauce it came with. 
*Beet Salad $7.50 - Enjoyed this as well, minus the store bought croutons. 
*Lobster and Crab Dip $11.50 - Smelled fishy in a bad way. 
*Pancetta Brussel Sprouts $4.00 - Good.

*Sigara Boregi $ 7.99 - phyllo dough stuffed with feta. I dipped these in this cucumber yogurt sauce. Pretty good. 
*Mixed Appetizer (small) $16.99 - delicious hummus, smokey baba, sweet grape leaf, cool lebni, chunky eggplant sauce, and tabouli. Oh my such great flavors! They give you some homemade Turkish round bread to rip apart and soak up the goods with. 
*Mixed Grill $26.99 - overpriced, but lots of meat: beef, chicken, lamb with rice. 
*Baklava $5.49 -  four small pieces. Tasty, just a lot of syrup. 
They also have Turkish versions of hot sauce, garlic sauce, and yogurt sauce.

Overall, I was happily surprised by the portion size and flavors of the food. Easily 3-4 meals depending on your appetite or amount of guests. I look forward to leftovers!

I've had this place bookmarked for ever so I was very glad when we came here for May supper club so I could finally check it out! Listen, I know coming into the city seems like a hassle for some, but it's worth it! I had no issue with traffic and scored a free parking spot on the street just a two minute walk from the restaurant. I got there around 5:30 which was just in time to enjoy their happy hour specials at the bar (HH is 4-6pm). Right off the bat we had excellent service! I think her name was Lilly or Libby? and she was on top of her game the entire time we were there. She knew about the menu, was friendly to chat with, and kept our orders right even though we moved from the bar to a table and split dishes. 

As for decor, I'd say this place is sleek and modern with an alluring vibe to it. They have a bar, single tables, and a big table off to the side that is partly covered with a chain curtain for a private party/more intimate feel. The high ceilings are draped with fabric and are light up. Just a cool place. Now, yes it's pricey, but you're downtown! Come on, it is what it is just enjoy the experience while you're there. And let's be real, the food is good. You're not going to regret anything. 

Speaking of food:
*Happy Hour Chickpea Jar $6 - Basically a hummus dip that you spread on warm bread. Very tasty and plenty enough to share. 
*Happy Hour Veggie Big Mac $6 - Great flavors, just a little on the mushy side for me. However that might be because we talked a lot and so it sat for a while. 
*Happy Hour Cocktails $8 - For HH you get a dollar off of the cocktails. I thought the strawberry smashers was refreshing and tasty. The blood orange cocktail was just okay.
*S'mores Hand Pie $9 - OMG AMAZING! Seriously really good, the stuff your belly dreams about. 

I would love to come back and try the salmon entree and some of their other dishes. A bit disappointed that they no longer have the bacon jam to go with the bread board, but eh you can't miss what you don't know. I also like how they have plenty of vegetarian friendly dishes so both meat and plant eaters can come here and be satisfied. 

The only weird thing is that they were not busy at all. Like I know it was a Wednesday evening, but just odd that there were only two groups dinning here. I am guessing people are just intimidated by the parking and prices, which is a shame because this place really is great. I know I would definitely come here again for a special occasion.

*Sauerkraut Balls $5.95 - Meh, the breading tasted off to me and why the heck is this paired with cocktail sauce? I would not order this again. 
*Cucumber Salad $5.95 - Refreshing, tasty, and a large portion meant to share. 
*Bavarian Pretzel $5.95 - Nice thick soft pretzel that paired well with the beer cheese dip (ask for extra dip!). 
*Potato Pancakes $5.95 - I liked that this was more pancake than hashbrown. Uniquely appealing with the sour cream and applesauce to top it with. 
*Pierogies $6.95 - We got one cheddar and one ricotta. I could not taste any cheddar, just potato. The ricotta was freaking awesome though. Tasted slightly sweet with some cinnamon? They are large sized but I think $7 is a little bit pricey for just 2. 
*Chicken Parikash $16.95 - Tasty. I prefer shredded white chicken, but with this version you will get a whole piece of white and one of dark meat, whatevs, still good. Spatzel was like delicious little puffs of cloud. You get a roll with your dinner but that's it. (The Little Polish Diner sells this dish for only $9.95)
*German Platter $16.95 - Would recommend if you would like a nice sampling of things. I especially liked the red cabbage and the schnitzel, the German potato salad had too much of a vinegar taste for me.

716,Qqh2cFO1bk5TQ8mWIEjbCw,4,"Hellz to the yeah! Such great flavors! I know people have been raving about the Porchetta ($9.50), but I thought the Smoked Turkey Club ($10) was better. Each sandwich comes with half a pickle, and these babies are done just right with a crisp crunch and a slight dill flavor. I personally believe you should alternate bites of sandwich with bites of pickle mmm. I'd say the sandwiches are about 6-7 inches in length with a decent amount of fillings, but I'd probably recommend rounding out the meal with a side of soup or one of their salads. The Tomato Bisque ($4) with blue cheese croutons was smooth and tasty. The Kale Caesar ($5.50) is simple and satisfying especially if you get it with the buttermilk parmesan dressing. They also sell Graham Pretzel Fudge Bars ($3) if you're craving a dessert. 

There was ample free street parking when I went, and once inside you're greeted by a friendly lady working the counter. Here she'll tell you how they try to get as many ingredients locally as they can, and they make as much as they can in-house. I'm talking the bread, dressings, soups, etc. Always love to hear/see/taste that! 

I'd definitely try this place out again. My only slight issue is that $15 for a sandwich and side seems a little pricey. Don't get me wrong, it's a tasty good meal, but no large portions nor super exceptional ingredients to warrant the price in my opinion. For $10 you can get 3 tacos and a side at Bomba, or a fried chicken dinner at Chow Chow, and for $12 you can get a burger and fries at Jammy Buggars. I think to make Herb n' Twine more of a regular stop than a once in a while treat, they'd need to throw in some meal deal specials or buy one get one half off coupons.

717,z9raV7X7cMhGhsOP-bxr7A,4,"Went here today for lunch for my department's holiday party and I must say we were all very pleased! The decor is clean and nice, and the staff friendly, but the star here is the hibachi! For lunch they give you a little house salad and for the main entree (I chose steak and chicken) they cook it up in front of you with tons of rice, noodles (yes noodles too!), veggies and meat. I especially liked Wasabi because they cook with plenty of butter and garlic which smells and tastes amazing. At other habachi places they over do it on the salt and soy sauce, but not here! I ended up leaving with a full box of leftovers which is always nice. It did seem really loud inside though, a little hard to hear others on the other side of the table, but if you just nod your head and smile, that usually works. The only real downside for me was that they don't give you fortune cookies after your meal and instead they have this weird flavored gum you can snag on your way out.

718,uSRgegdEFHHasT5BbRkcFA,5,"OMG SO GOOD! I saw this place pop up in my Yelp feed and immediately bookmarked it as a place to check out ASAP and so glad I did! Other reviews say this place is hard to find, but a quick look at the map and you can see it is in the middle of East 8th street (a side street between Prospect and Euclid), and if you're going East on Euclid you can see a big banner on the side of the building. I was lucky and got a spot right on Euclid and with a few quick steps I was inside and quickly seated at the bar with my friend. 

First off, very nice modern and classy decor, and very spacious. The kind of style that doesn't need to try and still comes off as an inviting and perfect setting for a business meeting, happy hour with friends, or date night with your lover. The music played overhead is neither loud nor annoying; my friend was actually doing a little shoulder shake in her chair to one of the songs. 

Now for the food. During happy hour their bar snacks are a dollar off, they have $6 fancy drink specials, and a discount on their craft beers on tap as well. I skipped the drinks tonight and aimed my focus on the food. I started with the homemade bacon and cheese tots and instead of their ketchup, I asked for a side of their cajun aioli to dip my tots in. I'll be honest here, I usually don't like tots because they are too small and fried for my tastes, but I hadn't had carbs in 5 days and I was about to stab someone so I went with the tots. SMART CHOICE! They come in a serving size of 8 and are maybe double the size of a regular pre-made frozen tot. Ohh and that canjun aioli? Just the perfect amount of kick that went really well with the tots. 

Next up was a reuben sans bun with green beans instead of the house chips. The corned beef had a delightful. unique, slightly sweet taste to it that really made it stand apart from the stuff you'd get at Slyman's or Danny's Deli. I was told this is because they make their own brine for the corned beef and use various spices like nutmeg in it. I also really enjoyed the side of green beans; they had a light seasoning of salt and pepper on them and were cooked perfectly in my opinion (not so soft and limp like canned beans, but also not so stiff and gross like the frozen ones). I did steal two noodles from my friend's jerk pasta and lordy lordy, I must say I don't know how people can remain composed and not lick the sauce off the bowl that stuff was so good! 

One of the owners stopped by to see how we were enjoying our experience; I ALWAYS appreciate a business taking the time to make sure their customers are enjoying themselves. We all got to talking and the owner showed us the private banquet room in the back that can fit about 45 people and has it's own bar. I would definitely suggest this place for a Yelp event, a supper club, or even a professionals networking event. 

My bill was $21 including tax and 20% tip. Not bad in my opinion especially when the food is homemade and has real flavor. If you check in with the Yelp app you get 10% off your bill, and hold on to that receipt because it is good for 10% off their Sunday brunch!

Fast forward to tonight where I was invited to participate in a little social tasting discussion on their new cocktails from 5-7pm. I was nervous to go on my own, but the staff was friendly and interactive, and my fellow tasters were quite pleasant as well and easy to socialize with. (Although I have started to notice that all social foodie events tend to mostly be made up of women or couples).

The night started with learning about and tasting all six new emulsive cocktails. I don't remember all of the names so I shall discuss them by their color:
Dark brown- tasted like cherries and balsamic vinegar.
Orange- made with carrots, tasted like perfume. 
Yellow?- tasted like apple/pumpkin pie. 
Pink- tasted fruity with a side of grass. 
Green- tasted like melons and black pepper. 
Tan- tasted sweet but finished spicy.

We also sampled some flatbreads:
BBQ Chicken- had a really good sauce. 
Vegan- actually surprised me that it tasted pretty good. Cheese was almost velvety. 
Prosciutto wrapped dates- sorry to say these ones were a little over cooked.

Overall I had a really enjoyable time and even took home an order of the chicken nachos which was pretty tasty minus the soggy chips.

722,l-TaawqI-mlN4z_N9WdW9Q,4,"A couple friends and I came here for a special wine and food pairing class ($27 including a processing fee) and I must say, we all really enjoyed the class! It was held in a room off to the side and each group had their own table set up and ready to go with several wine and food samples. Our instructor was very personable and did a pretty decent job of going through her slide show, explaining the different kinds of wine, and answering my random questions. As she talked we would try a wine and food pairing and discuss if the flavors brought out the best in each other (like pinot noir with a wild mushroom ravioli, or riesling with a grilled shrimp on a sliced cucumber with peach habanero preserves). At the end we got to do some experimenting and deciding on our own what cheeses would taste best with what wines. 

I didn't really care for most of the wine, but to be fair I prefer sweet reds or Moscato. I was also a bit disappointed that they get their grapes from California, but I was told this was due to timing (and familiarity with a business out there) and they might look around for grapes closer to home for the next batches. I did like the layout of this place, it's got that laid-back/stylish/industrial vibe to it and I could definitely see myself coming back to enjoy a wine slushie.

I have not been to a Red Lobster in many many years, but I was really craving some shrimp and they had their special going on so I was like ""let's do this!""

Roll up on a Sunday afternoon with a friend and we both got the all you can eat shrimp special for $17.99. With the meal you get a salad and a side. I went with a caesar salad and upgraded to the lobster mashed potatoes. Just a tip, ask for your dressing on the side, otherwise your salad is going to be saturated with dressing. Our waiter Tim brought us out some fresh cheddar bay biscuits. For the shrimp I tried the buttery scampi, the new Nashville hot, coconut shrimp bites, and the shrimp alfredo. The Nashville hot was really good - fried, with a spicy kick and a drizzle of sweet honey. The alfredo is a huge portion with a hint of garlic. They let you take home your leftovers which provided me with two more meals! 

Our waiter Tim was on top of his game. Pleasant and attentive. The manager even stopped by twice to check in on us which I thought was a nice touch.

I pulled into the Marcs plaza and easily found a close by parking spot. Once inside there was a short line of other patrons placing orders/waiting for food. When it came time for my turn to order the man at the counter was personable. 

I went with the Kafta Grill for $10.95. It has 3 formed meat chunks of a lamb and beef mixture that I found to be moist and seasoned just right (meat is made in-house). The meat comes with sauteed onions and green peppers on top of a pita slice with a creamy sauce and fresh parsley sprinkled on top. This platter also comes with fresh cut fries and at least a cup of hummus. The fries could have been cooked a minute longer, but that is just my personal preference for slightly crispy fries (any place with fresh cut fries gets points in my book!). The hummus is pretty simple but the garnish of whole chickpeas, parsley, and paprika really is pleasing to the eyes. I also got a big whole pita to tear up for my hummus and a side of tzatziki sauce to dip my fries in. 

For an after dinner treat I got one triangle of walnut baklava and one triangle of pistachio baklava at $1.25 each. The latter was not sweet in my opinion, more so it had a buttery nutty flavor to it. The walnut variety was sweeter and although I think it could use just a bit more sweetness (I like my baklava with noticeable syrup/honey), it was still good. *Disclaimer: I actually ate these in the car on my drive home so they were more like a pre-dinner treat instead. 

To sum it up, I think Falafel Xpress makes fresh, simple, tasty food that will definitely fill you up and still leave some for leftovers! Take a break from that Chipotle chain next door and get yourself a Gyro with that tasty tahini sauce on it! (Or whatever, I don't know what you like to eat).

733,sCzH5JftPOVrhIMIrniodg,4,"I had no idea this place was located next to La Plaza Supermarket and their fantastic tacos! I am a fan of Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food so I decided to check Ferris out one evening. This place is very unassuming, but I saw customers outside, inside, and customers picking up to-go orders so I say that is a good sign! The lady who helped me decide what to get was friendly and patient. 

Apparently the shawarma platters used to come with coleslaw, garlic paste, hot sauce, pickles, fries, and a meat roll, but I was told they no longer do the coleslaw since not many people ate it and instead just do double garlic paste. The kind lady behind the counter let me get hummus instead of double garlic paste and she let me get half beef and half chicken. Definitely appreciate a place that works with me on trying different things without having to order a bunch of meals! I also opted for a baklava roll and my bill came to $10.50. 

The platter is a pretty generous portion size, like pretty sure a whole basket of fries was included! They are of the frozen variety, but eh, still edible especially when dipped in that wonderful garlic paste mmm. I also really liked the meat roll, both the chicken and the beef. Nothing was dried up or over cooked at all, instead flavorful and tender. The hummus however, not so good. Tasted like a plain chickpea and I left it alone after a couple bites (definitely needs some more lemon or garlic or something to add flavor). That Baklava roll was pretty tasty though!

Overall I would come here again. Not the healthiest of meals, but good and the price is right. Portion size is big and I have leftovers in my fridge.

734,DJEr4QaIcRakvWjyUYBimA,4,"Went here with a large group. Tastings/tapas on the pricier side. Tried several things. Depending on what you get, you'd need 3 plates each to be full. More likely just a place for a drink and a snack before dinner elsewhere. Décor is on the trendy industrial intimate side (wood, metal, exposed brick, soft lights). Server was excellent (knowledgeable and attentive). 

*Manchego cheese - Nothing special at all. Get the cheese from a grocery store and eat at home. 
*Smoked Beet Salad - Had a bite of this and thought the flavors worked really well together. 
*White Bean Puree $8 - The best thing I ate! Very good. Four points of toast is not enough though, and I ended up eating the puree with a spoon.  
*Stuffed Dates $8 - Good, but expensive at $2 per little date (4 per order).
*Calamari $10 - This was tasty, really enjoyed the coconut sauce. 
*Sweet Potato Croquette - Seemed plain to me. 
*Short Rib - Had a bite and thought the meat was cooked perfectly. 
*Angle food cake - Good/okay, but lacked enough sauce and fruit to make it great. 

Seems like they have some tempting sounding concoctions; but dishes are either excellent or completely fall short of expectations. Some plates were smaller portion sizes than others (and they were all already tapas sized). Menu has changed since my visit in September. I think if you  prepare yourself to spend money, eat several small plates, and are willing to gamble on what is going to be good, then this place will be satisfying.

We showed up at Happy Dog a little after 5 and got ourselves a booth. This time around I enjoyed the atmosphere so much more because there was no band playing or crowd to fight through; I could actually talk to my date without yelling across the table! But, if we are going to be honest here there was not much talking, more so there was shoveling of hot dogs, tater tots topped with mac & cheese, and craft beers down our gullets. 

I keep messing up at this place because I want to try something different so I order this fancy concoction of a hot dog and immediately regret my choice. Thankfully my date got the chili cheese dog and offered to switch with me. So the lesson here, for me at least, is stick with what you know tastes good! No need to step outside the box and put craziness on a perfectly good all beef wiener. However I do recommend putting the mac & cheese on those tots, mmm so good.

Thankfully I had contacted the owner in advance to discuss the details and let him know a group of ten was coming in, otherwise I don't think we would have gotten to taste that glorious BBQ! At 6:30 on a Wednesday evening they already had a long line and were sold out of a some major items! For us we did this special family style where Shane brought out a big tray of ribs, brisket, pulled pork, and turkey. We also got a tray of the fixin's like white bread, raw onion, and pickles to compliment our bbq (I used it all to make a sandwich). Oh and not to forget the sides of potato salad, coleslaw, and baked beans! 

We sat at the two long tables in the middle of the restaurant and our plates were thicker strips of paper and the silverware was plastic, but it all worked and was easy to clean up! On the tables were large shareable jars of sauce and rolls of paper for napkins. For drinks you got your own from a soda fountain, but I think they have beer as well. 

Food:
Ribs were amazing! They had this great black pepper rub, but adding the bbq sauce really did it for me. There was definitely meat on the bone and it was cooked perfectly, nothing dry here! The brisket was delicious as well! Tender and a little moist with a lovely little layer of fat. The turkey and pulled pork were A-Okay, the later was just a little dry but the sauce and eating it sandwich style with coleslaw on top made it taste just fine for me. I did taste a bite of their sausage, it was spicy but a little too greasy for me. As for the sides, they were simple, nothing special, but I had no real complaints. I did like that the coleslaw was not in a bath of salad dressing. Ahhh and we got a little cup of banana pudding for dessert which I thought was a perfect finish to the meal!

Overall I enjoyed what The Proper Pig had to offer and I will be returning! The stars of the show are definitely the meats, but I would not mind if they perked up the sides a little, maybe added some gooey mac & cheese and cornbread mmm.

740,829Kv1uZJj5q8sr2G0mnvA,4,"I'd like to thank my fellow Yelper's for recommending this place. We had a craving for pizza so we drove 45 minutes each way to pick up some pies and I'll have to say there are no regrets. The pizza party at my house contained the following:

*The Spinachi - Garlic butter sauce, sausage, spinach, sunflower seeds, cranberries, feta and asiago cheese. The garlic butter sauce really upped the tastiness of the crust. The cranberries added a nice sweetness and the sunflower seeds were a pleasant little crunch. All of the ingredients worked well in this pizza. 
*Philly Cheese Steak - My favorite! Alfredo sauce, swiss-american cheese, philly steak meat, onions, green peppers (left off the mushrooms). Such a tasty pizza! No wonder they won an award for it. 
*Supreme Pizza - Pretty standard toppings and taste. The crust was not as tasty as the specialty pizza's and I think it could have used a little more red sauce. A decent pizza, but no wow factor. 

The pizzas are on the fluffier side with a thick crust. Overall I prefer the specials over the regular pies and at $9.99 for a small, these pizzas are very affordable. If I was passing through Valley City I would definitely get pizzas from here again!

I stopped by after work and since I got there before the fish fry started at 5:30pm I decided to sit at the bar and enjoy their happy hour menu while I waited. Select appetizers were half off so I got the flautas barbacoa ($3.25) and the goat cheese guac ($3.50). Both were pretty tasty, however I would not pay the full price for the guac unless the portion size was increased.   They also give you some chips and salsa (tasted a little hot/spicy to me) to snack on while you wait. Since I got my fish fry to-go and it arrived shortly after the appetizers did, they allowed me to box up the unfinished appetizers (I barely touched them). A young blonde waitress was pretty friendly and the old blonde one seemed pretty cranky. Atmosphere was pleasant and there seemed to be plenty of regulars inside. 

Now the star of the show, the fish fry! ($13). It came with two pieces of fish, chipotle tartar sauce, mac & cheese, cucumber and carrot slaw/salad, and Mexican grilled corn. YUM! The fish was fried perfectly, not too heavy on the batter. The slaw/salad was crisp and refreshing. The mac & cheese was gooey which was awesome.

742,k0Bj4ZYyoICz6Mhx2f9Udg,4,"I think River Dog Cafe is the perfect example as to why you should give a place a second try. My first time here I was meh about the food, second time around however I find myself much more pleased with everything! I've actually been back about half a dozen times I like it so much. 

Their hot dogs are nice and plump; I usually get the Adam Bomb with brisket and cheese sauce, but I ask them to remove the bacon and add coleslaw right on the dog. This makes it so much more tastier, so although a little messy, it's definitely worth it. The cheese seems different as well, or maybe since they don't use foil anymore to wrap up the to-go dogs there is no longer the problem of the cheese sticking to the foil. 

The fries are the same, still frozen, but made to look like fresh cut fries so they are the best of the frozen kind in my opinion. I really enjoy dipping them in the red pepper aioli. I did try the loaded fries with chili (meat sauce), cheese sauce and sour cream, but unfortunately I did not care for them. I still have a thing against their chili (meat sauce), it's just too sweet. 

The staff here are always pleasant, and for less than $10 you can get a big loaded hot dog with a side which is plenty enough to fill you up for hours. I would recommend River Dog Cafe!

If you're lucky to find some street parking that is great, otherwise plan to spend an extra $10 or so on parking. Once you come inside you will be hit with an almost overwhelming smell of meat, but you'll get accustomed to it and it fades after a while. The atmosphere is pretty chill, lots of people at the bar, long tables to share with other diners, and cool beer glasses with the B&B logo on them. Downside to this big space though is that it is very loud, so loud that we had to keep repeating ourselves because we couldn't hear what the other one was saying and we were only two feet apart. There are huge empty walls, maybe put up some sound absorbing panels or something?

I started things off with a 4 beer sampler for $10. Samplers are always a great way to taste what a place has to offer without committing to a full glass just yet. Next up I ordered the Hand-Ground Burger which was pretty tasty and perfectly cooked. Although it's $12 for just the burger, which to me that is a little pricey. To go with my burger I got the Loaded Kennebec Fries for $12 and it's a big enough portion for sharing. Make sure you say loaded kennebec though, because apparently just saying kennebec means regular plain fries, which I don't understand because regular plain fries are usually just called fries? The loaded kennebec fries were tasty, but what wouldn't be tasty with cheese and pork belly on it?

All in all, you'll spend a good buck coming here and paying for parking, but the prices are in-line with it being downtown and the food was good so you can't complain too much.

This place is close to my work so it's was pretty convenient to stop here to pick up dinner on my way home. It's located in a newer looking plaza between Aldi's and Ruby Tuesday's. Plenty of parking. The inside is clean and has this upscale but still warm, Italian vibe. As for staff, one gentleman didn't seem to be very knowledgeable but on another occasion the woman who helped me was fantastic! Very friendly and experienced. 


-Italian Blue Smoke Pizza $12: 6 small slices that I thought were just okay. Other reviewers seem to find it pretty tasty.
-Lemon Parmesan Chicken $14 - I did enjoy this, a nice light lemon and cream flavor, would have liked more sauce. However, I was disappointed it didn't include a small side salad (this seems to be something only old school mom and pop places do anymore). The lunch portion you only get one chicken breast but that is plenty and it includes a salad or soup for $11, a much better meal and deal in my opinion.  
-Sausage Stuffed Peppers $8: This was very good! You get two but they are nice sized. Would have preferred a little more sauce, but I like that it came 2 slices of the house bread. 
-Junior's Spicy Calamari $11: Legit baby squid, none of that fake rubbery sliced stuff, and it comes with lemon to squeeze over it. I noticed a ton of peppers and onions though, at least an equal portion to the squid which should have been the star of the show. 
-Cookies 3 for $2.75: Lemon drop and what I think were nut horn cookies? A nice little after dinner treat. Supposedly made by a local baker, but they didn't know who.


Overall I would go here again and I would recommend giving it at least one try. I know in the future I would ask for more sauce, but that is because I am a saucy kind of lady.

749,_HqZV2Y9VGPNFbSMNs84bQ,4,"Located in a strip mall. Manager is pleasant. Owners were working hard in the open kitchen during a light lunch rush. Decor is modern with several tables if you want to dine in. Pick Two $14 comes with 2 sides. Pick Three $16 comes with 2 sides. Each additional side is $2 and they come in 4oz? containers. They also have sandwich combos with one side or 1/2lbs of meat and 2 sides. I would say the portions sizes and prices are reasonable and roughly in-line with places like Mission BBQ, Proper Pig, and Woodstock. 

Pulled Pork - Excellent. Moist, tender and I enjoyed the BBQ sauce with it. Good even when reheated the next day! 

Beef Brisket - Moist and tender. Served in two long slices. Would have been great if it was not 2/3 fat. I mean, fat adds flavor, but this was just way too much. Just need to trim up their slices and it would be perfect. 

Ribs - Tender, pulled off the bone easily, but not my favorite. 

Kielbasa - Seemed okay, I don't care for kielbasa in general so no opinion on this. 

Burnt Ends - I was expecting burnt ends like how Oak and Embers serves them, these leaned more towards little chunks of jerky. Not bad, but I would not get them again. 

Coleslaw - Nice crunch. Has a taste of citrus to it. Really enjoyed this, and was disappointed that they only filled the container up half way. 

Bread Pudding - Really enjoyed this even without the raisins. Very tasty!

Mac & Cheese - Great idea, not executed well enough though. It's saucy and has a crushed cracker topping but the cheese they use is bright orange and if I had to guess it's the kind you find in a bag at the convenience store that you pump into a tray for pretzels or nachos. 

Cheesy Grits - Okay, but unfortunately they used that fake cheese sauce again. 

Baked Beans - Not bad, but nothing special about these. 

BBQ Sauce - Regular or Spicy. Nothing too crazy so don't expect potent smokey, sweet, vinegar, whatever notes. It's pretty simple but works well! 

Cookie $1 - Normal sized and actually a really good chocolate chip cookie but super dry burnt ends that are baked into it did not work. Would not buy again unless they take out the burnt ends. 

I was torn between a 3 and 4 star rating for Ribsticks. The texture of their pulled pork and brisket is perfect, but there is not a lot of flavor to it so don't expect to see much of a rub or smoke ring on the meats. Just add some of their BBQ sauce though and you'll be fine. I was happy to see that they did not over price their sides and I really enjoyed the coleslaw and bread pudding a lot. If they could make their cheese sauce from scratch I think that would make their mac & cheese phenomenal. Kick up their baked beans a notch with some more flavor and they would be really great too. I was told they were working on making corn bread which is something I always love to see at BBQ places. 

Overall I think they have a pretty good start to things in the BBQ world. They are new so they do have some tweaking to do if they really want to rank high amongst their competitors, but I would definitely give them another try!",3089,0.026243433189266627,0.06454588606795299,0.10382017087232807,0.050432989951484514,0.01036016178754852,0.7445973581314194,"strip,mall,manager,owners,kitchen,lunch,rush,tables,sides,side,oz,containers,sandwich,combos,meat,portions,sizes,prices,line,places,moist,tender,bbq,sauce,day,slices,flavor,bone,kielbasa,opinion,ends,chunks,jerky,crunch,taste,citrus,container,way,raisins,idea,saucy,cracker,topping,cheese,kind,bag,convenience,store,tray,pretzels,nachos,cheesy,grits,nothing,smokey,vinegar,chocolate,chip,cookie,star,rating,texture,pork,brisket,lot,rub,smoke,ring,meats,price,coleslaw,bread,scratch,mac,phenomenal,beans,notch,corn,something,start,things,world,tweaking,competitors,try","kitchen,meat,prices,store,bread","line,day,way"
750,ugGMhvYnjheG3rHKxK2-gQ,5,"I've been craving a waffle for like eight months now and haven't been able to find one that satisfied my craving... until now! We called ahead to see what the hours were and the owner said they'd be closing between 7 and 8pm, but he stayed open until we could rush over there which was really nice of him. Once inside Tower City we couldn't find the stand right away, but another quick call to the owner and before we knew it, voilà! delicious Belgian waffles for everyone! The owner was very friendly and readily provided information about his unique product. 

We both got a waffle with speculoos (cookie butter) drizzled over it with fresh cut strawberries, a big shot of whip cream, and a light dusting of powdered sugar. The waffles are made with dough instead of batter which gives them this nice crispy outside and a soft doughy inside. I've never had speculoos before, but this stuff is delicious! The strawberries added a nice fresh cut to the other toppings, and this waffle was just overall a very pleasing yummy treat!

I didn't have a ruler with me, but I'd say the waffles are about 5x4 inches big and mine came to $9.

751,Y-oPVMkxgEsve1sG2iDLXA,4,"I'm not sure how to rate my visit to Citizen Pie...

Pros:
-If you're looking for a bite to eat, a quick drink, or to people watch it's a great place to chill before a show at Beachland Ballroom.
-The pizza is tasty. We tried the special ($16) which was chicken sausage, sweet corn, cherry tomatoes, and jalapeno honey. Mmm very good. I don't like this particular crust, but my friend ate it up. 
-I want to try this chocolate dessert thing that they have. 

Neutral:
-It's a serve yourself kind of place. Like you go up to the counter to order and pay. They hand you the goods. You get your own plates, silverware, napkins, and bus your own table. 
-It's a small space so probably not good for groups and the inside environment is most comfortable when it's not busy (no elbow to elbow seating for me!). 

Cons:
-Either they don't have A/C or they don't use it. On a hot day with a hot oven they had the door open so it was pretty warm inside. This is especially not good on humid days. 
-I asked for water and they only offer bottled water $2 or sparkling water $3. No thanks, so I asked for a cup for water so I could use the tap and the guy looked at me like I was an alien speaking nonsense. Like dude, I'm not going to pollute the Earth with plastic bottles nor am I going to pay for water, I'm perfectly fine drinking city filtered tap water. So they gave me a tiny little 4oz glass to get water out of the bathroom sink.  
-The prices are in line with the ""we're cool and hip so we cost more"" pricing system. (I need to wrap this up because my saltiness (due to dehydration) over that water situation is dripping (not enough to spill) into this review).

I would go with a 3.5 but since we can't do half stars I will move it up to 4. Besides the awkward water conversation, the two guys working there were pleasant, the pizza was good, and its a great place to meet before a show. I think I am going to give them another try, I'll just have to bring my own glass to drink water out of.

Tavern Tater Tots ($10) - homemade round tots with an artichoke fondue. Not bad, but I was unimpressed as this dish seemed plain to me and I would probably not get it again. 

Blackened Shrimp Tacos ($12) - You get three in an order and they aren't very big, but they tasted good. 

Avocado Chicken Flatbread ($12) - They did a bad job of evenly putting the toppings on, but this was pretty tasty and I would definitely get it again. 

I got the food to-go so I can't really speak too much on this, but the place seemed clean and the bartender was friendly. There are some other tasty sounding items on the menu that I want to try, and the appetizers are all half off during happy hour so definitely a great deal if you are looking to try a couple things.

755,bK5nWi1oNs63utSlzmRUNg,4,"Went here last night for supper club and I enjoyed it! There were five of us and we easily split a bunch of appetizers then each got our own bowl of ramen. 

*On special Vietnamese sausage dumplings in a creamy corn sauce $8 - you get five in an order and I thought they were really good. 
*Crispy veggie dumpling $7 - nice if you're looking for something fried, but other than that not memorable. Again, five in an order. 
*On special spicy mango pork bao $7 - tasty and lots of meat! Two in an order so perfect for sharing. 
*On special kimchi balls $10 -  three in an order and you can pick a couple different varieties. Good, but they all seemed to taste the same. Reminded me of a large risotto ball. 
*Spicy miso ramen $12 (plus $1 for soy egg add on) - large bowl of soup with dense eggy noodles, fatty slice of pork, corn, bean sprouts instead of mushrooms, a soy soft boiled egg, and this spicy chili pepper broth that had my mouth on fire. It was good, I just struggled a bit with it. Everyone at the table actually got the same thing and it seemed like everyone enjoyed it. Has potential to make you sweat and make your nose run though! 

Some more details: street parking available. I think it is nice to see these once dilapidated buildings get a refreshing makeover. Along the same street you have Platform Brewery and Herb & Twine. Atmosphere inside is simple industrial but nice, however the lighting gets pretty dim in the evening so perfect spot if you want to look better to your date. Low lighting + alcohol = instant boost in attractiveness. 

Service. So our server technically did well - she did not neglect us, kept the water flowing, continuously cleared the table, separated the checks appropriately, but I would not describe her as a pleasant person. I'd say her personality towards our group was more that of a well seasoned server who had died inside over the years. No smile, no friendliness, not mean, but you could almost imagine she was hoping for your death when you asked her to switch out your water because there was something floating in the bottom of it. 

Overall our group had a really good time eating tasty food and chatting about all things. I can definitely see myself picking up a to-go order of soup this winter (just maybe not the spicy one again, I am weak).

So what makes this place so great? First off their mission; instant points for being a place that helps formerly incarcerated persons by giving them a chance at a successful transition back into society by teaching them a skilled trade, offering support and guidance, and empowering them through passion for the hospitality industry. And let me tell you, these people are more than willing to serve you, to try and excel at what they are doing, and provide everyone with a great experience. It all started with my communications with the manager, Jordan, he was personable and more than accommodating when my supper club reservations kept increasing in size. Then there were our waiters, Matt and Robert, both played along with my feisty harassing of them and served our table of 17 with plenty of smiles and without any major issues. 

Next up, the food! I'll be real wit cha, I did not really care for the bread they serve but that is no biggie. But I was into the unique French dishes they provided which are perfect if your palette is open to exploring things like frog legs $15, escargot (a little earthy), and fois gras. They also have an excellent cheese selection and lobster bisque soup if you'd rather play things on the safe side. Next up are the main dishes, mmm I still think about that horseradish crusted salmon in a creamy cucumber sauce $28 mmm drooling... they also had this tasty beef and noodles dish, venison cooked perfectly (no chewy gamey meat here), a pretty scallops dish, and things get real fancy when you order a burger because they grind it up and fry it tableside! 

For dessert they offer bananas foster which they cook tableside as well, but this had a strong alcohol taste to it so I did not really care for it, but let me tell you, they make their drinks $11 deceivingly strong too and my silly mouthy side was in full force this night after just two tasty concoctions! (Disclaimer, I specifically asked for fruity sweet drinks, they definitely have the kind of cocktails that burn going down and pack a bunch if you're more into putting hair on your chest). Back to the desserts, they have apple torts and chocolate cakes and souffles, really there is something for everyone. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Edwins and it appeared the other 16 guests at my cozy table by the fireplace enjoyed their experience as well. Sure it's pricey, but so worth it, plus you're helping out a wonderful cause so don't act like you can't save up and splurge once in a while (start practicing your ""Oh la la's""!).

First time I came here it was on a Friday right after work, just me at the bar around 5:30pm. Everything was fine, I was just chilling and enjoying my happy hour drink (Cosmo $5, Blod Sangria $10) and some light bites (deviled egg $3 and bacon wrapped dates $10). Staff was personable and helpful with menu selections. BUT THEN 6pm rolled around and the place instantly filled up with well-off white guys over 45. There were some older ladies as well, but I was definitely the youngest person in there. 

It got incredibly loud, guys surrounded my bar stool like an old man wall between me and freedom. My plans to enjoy solo happy hour time were dashed by men talking about their kids names, Trump, and how they don't age. Dude, I have eyes, you've definitely aged. This place got so busy inside that the four people behind the bar could not keep up, men were loudly complaining about how they ordered a beer 10 minutes ago. I can't hate on them for complaining, I myself was a bit disgruntled that I was waiting so long for my to-go order (duck confit mac & cheese $18 - good but too fatty for me) and had to ask about it several times. It was ready, just no one had time to grab it and cash me out. So I sat and awkwardly waited, desperately texting my friends for some sort of reprieve from this loud-all up in my space-old man madness I was experiencing. 

I was finally able to escape! I broke through the wall of gray hair (they have money, they can afford hair plugs) and quickly went to my car where I immediately took a selfie to capture the look of repulsion on my face and shared it everyone. When life is crazy, make fun of it. 

Second visit I came on a Tuesday after work with a friend. Again around 5:30pm in the bar area. This time, while the place did become steady with patrons, it was still a good atmosphere where staff was able to pay attention to you and you could relax and chat with a friend without yelling or feeling like you were smashed in. There seemed to also be more of a mix of people, while not a lot of twenty somethings, it wasn't all geriatrics either. I enjoyed $2/$3 tacos with lettuce wraps for shells then my friend and I split a crème brûlée $9. 

So to sum it up, I enjoyed the food and you can get good deals on happy hour items or daily specials.

Sad news is that I could not stop with one bite and devoured the whole thing. By. Myself.  I guess the good news is that we created a food baby who is due any time now. 

I discovered this place through Uber Eats and I really have nothing bad to say!

* Southwest Chicken Salad $8.50 - HUGE! And they let me add more veggies to it (cucumber and black olive) which I really appreciated. 
* Homemade Meatballs $7 - Tasty, moist, and topped with tomato sauce, fresh ricotta cheese, and basil. 
* Cheesy Garlic Bread sticks $6 - These were nothing special, but still good.

Staff is always so pleasant when I come in and when you talk to the owners you can tell they really delight in what they are doing, they care about their customers, and they genuinely want you to have a tasty food experience.

Currently I'm shoving their mac & cheese special into my mouth between sentences. Seriously this isn't even what I originally ordered but it is soooooooo good! I had called today to get my regular taco meal, but when I got there I just could not resist the temptation of trying their mac & cheese special. I had only wanted to try a tiny sample, but they ended up making me a full order! Getting back to work I was like ""okay, I can have just one bite then I'll put this away for dinner later"". In reality I had one bite and could not stop! After taking a breath and realizing I ate 2/3 of this and my pants were about to split and I was about to slide under my desk in a delicious food coma, I stopped. I put the fork down, closed the lid, put it back in the bag and shoved it out of sight before the tasty carbs had a chance to completely take over my mind.

Sweet baby Jesus I am going to end up on that show, ""My 600lbs Life"". 

But listen, it was good. Real good. 

A huge portion with their pulled pork on top. The pasta was gemelli in this creamy coat-your-insides cheese sauce. To me it tasted like there was fresh garlic and chopped fresh tomatoes hidden in this masterpiece. 

I'm struggling to keep my eyes open; the food coma is here! 

I have to go for a walk around the building so I'll wrap this review up. I 100% support this local restaurant and hope that they continue to succeed!

Angelo, sometimes your food is really good! That deep dish seafood pizza! Those plump wings covered in sauce! One time you messed up my order and delivered a corrected pizza to me even though I was outside your delivery zone (just barely outside). All great things, but then other times I get a pizza and it's a little lackluster and the wings are on the small side with little sauce. So I've gotta take away a star. Your food is generally good, but for the price I expect it to be awesome all of the time. 

I mean, I am still going to hit you up now and then, maybe it's my fault for putting you on a pedestal, but I think we need to just be friends for awhile, I need some time to think things over and see what other pizza pies are out there.",756,0.06864890657872047,0.7029624349941529,0.07501714027756687,0.0,0.0,0.15337151814955954,"food,dish,seafood,pizza,wings,sauce,time,order,delivery,zone,things,times,side,star,price,fault,pedestal,friends,pies","food,seafood","time,order,delivery,times"
767,DuMWyxL4DMcy5A8MXD_67w,4,"Gather round people, I've got a story to tell. First part: Hole-in-the-Wall Food. Second part: I'm Being Haunted by My Online Dates. 

Part 1.
Parkview is a definitely hole-in-the-wall place with an outside that seems like it might be a bit sketchy and a dated inside full of locals singing Mariah Carey Christmas songs. BUT do not let this deter you! As long as you're not stuck up Parkview will greet you with character and a little dusty charm. We had our monthly supper club here the other night and our server, Debbie, did an excellent job of taking care of a group of ten. She kept my water filled, answered any questions I had, and no issue with the many checks. 

The food here comes from a partnership between Parkview favorites and creations from the owner/chef, Joe, of the now closed Chow Chow in Lakewood. I started off with sharing an order of the deep fried piergoies $7 accompanied by burnt onion dip. You get three large potato pierogies that are very tasty. Next up several of us ordered the fried chicken with mac & cheese and a side of coleslaw instead of french fries. I had the original from Chow Chow, and while this version was okay, it was not as good. They are no longer able to get affordable meaty chicken breasts so they now go with one thigh and two legs (I prefer white meat so this was a little disappointing). Batter is still hearty with a good crunch. The mac & cheese is different, not as smooth, more of a gritty texture (roux issue, heat issue, type of cheese issue, or done on purpose, no idea). Overall though for $11 it was a decent meal that won't break the bank. Those who ordered this had plenty of leftovers to take home. 

I also ordered the corn succotash with polenta cake $11 to-go and I am so glad I did! Like the pierogies this dish was just like the original and still just as satisfying. I can't wait to go home and eat it for dinner tonight! It's a heavy meal but they give you assorted pickled veggies which helps cut the fat. As for other items on the menu I would definitely come back to try the French dip $9 (always in search of the best one) and the friend goat cheese salad $9. I might stay away from the pulled pork dinner $11.50 though because it came out with the fries swimming in the pork juice which left them soggy. There was also some sadness over the fried cheese curds from Chow Chow not being on this new menu (bring back that smoked banana corn ice cream sandwich!).

Overall I had a nice time in a chill environment surrounded by friends and I would come back for certain menu items. Plus Joe is a nice friendly guy so I have no problem supporting this local business. 

Part 2.
Roughly 3 years ago I went on a date with this guy who called himself Jeff the Butcher (he liked fondling raw meat, jk). He's an attractive guy and in all honestly the date was good: some SideQuest trivia, a kiss, and plans to meet again. It was his negative drunken follow up call a couple days later that killed things. Don't randomly complain about friends/family and excessively curse at someone you just met. 
 
Fast forward like a year and half later when I'm having a feisty Sunday with a friend at Banter and it turns out he is the cook there. Read that review for details. 

Present day Cleveland Supper Club is at Parkview. I notice this guy in the kitchen keeps looking at our table. I'm looking back wondering if this guy is familiar and who the heck is he? It's JEFF THE FREAKING BUTCHER. The kicker here is that the prior week Butcher man is showing Joe my yelp reviews. 

Moral of this story is that I eat out too much and I'm gonna die alone. On the bright side I live a fun successful life so sugar mama status is not far away. Soon I'll be able to afford Raúl the handsome ""handyman"" so don't feel bad for me.",3779,0.13430887258536128,0.010317405909184669,0.0,0.10161699448500933,0.06593380775832577,0.6878229192621191,"people,story,part,hole,wall,place,outside,bit,locals,songs,character,charm,supper,club,night,server,job,care,group,water,questions,issue,checks,food,partnership,favorites,creations,owner,chef,order,piergoies,onion,dip,potato,pierogies,chicken,mac,cheese,side,coleslaw,fries,version,meaty,breasts,thigh,legs,meat,batter,crunch,texture,roux,heat,type,purpose,idea,meal,bank,plenty,leftovers,corn,succotash,polenta,dish,dinner,tonight,veggies,fat,items,menu,search,friend,goat,salad,pork,juice,sadness,curds,banana,ice,cream,sandwich,time,chill,environment,friends,guy,problem,business,years,date,trivia,kiss,couple,days,things,family,someone,year,half,cook,review,details,day,kitchen,table,heck,freaking,butcher,kicker,week,man,yelp,life,sugar,mama,status,handyman","care,water,food,chicken,meat,meal,items,business,kitchen,sugar","part,job,care,order,search,time,business,years,days,year,day,week"

I showed up a little early and the staff and fellow customers greeted me with warm and friendly attitudes! They also helped me figure out what the heck I was supposed to do to get in on this trivia action. I sat at the bar and ordered a Butter Beer (if you've read Harry Potter you have to try one!). This concoction was was sweet, but tasty and I enjoyed pretending I was a Muggle. Once my date arrived we played Pictionary and soon started to fret about how terribly bad we were at knowing facts! However, once the trivia started the whole bar was full of laughs and we were not alone with our terrible guesses. We ended up placing 14th out of 15 teams, but that is not last so I call it a win!

They have happy hour from 3-6pm so we were able to grab some tasty calamari for $5.50 and a a strawberry collins cocktail for $5. I liked that the calamari came with this vinegar dipping sauce, since the dish was fried this worked even better than the typical aioli that you would get (vinegar helps cut the fatty taste). 

For main course I splurged and got the lobster pasta for $27.49. Definitely pricey, but it was a hearty dish and tasted good. My dining companion got a fish dish for the same price and they enjoyed their meal as well. You also get bread and spread to snack on. 

I think one thing that stood out to me was the service. Immediately upon our arrival at the bar the staff was on top of things and personable. This lasted our entire visit and I was happy to leave a nice tip. 

I would definitely come back here! I think happy hour is a great deal (plenty of options for around $5), staff is friendly, and it's close to the theatre.

Staff is A-Okay, I think they try their best even when it gets crazy busy. Food is good too. Nothing smack-you-momma spectacular, but always satisfying. It's like simple, fresh deli food with some Mediterranean dishes mixed in. I've had their Mediterranean Platter (with Tabbouleh, Hommus and Baba Ganooj), the California Chicken Club, and their Tuna Melt.

772,qDqHD4iPXPecT1WnV0JRzA,4,"Finally stopped in one night with a friend before a Broadway show at Playhouse Square and this place was hoppin! We were able to snag one of the last available seats in the side room at the front where we were attended to by a prompt and friendly waitress. We each got a glass of wine and shared some snacks/small plates in chill yet classy environment. The front room has a huge window so it's also a good spot if you just want to relax, have a drink, and people watch. 

There was a slight hiccup, my friend paid the bill and I offered to leave the cash tip, but I mistakenly left too little and didn't realize it until we were sitting at Connor Palace. Luckily Bin 216 is open until 11pm so we were able to run back over once our show was done and set things right with the tipping. This also allowed for my friend to have another drink and for me to get some food to go!

Hanky Panky's $5
Seafood Risotto $15

If you are familiar with Hodge's then you know the first two items are on their menu as well; both tasty snacks and I could eat a dozen of each! The risotto grew on me with each bite and as for the nachos, those were good, but disappointed the sauce was sitting in a pool on the bottom of the plate instead of all over the wonton chips. 

Overall, I would definitely come here again! I like the atmosphere, it's right next door to the theatre, plenty of parking garages/lots, good service, and good food.

I stopped by with a friend on a Sunday afternoon after a workout and we enjoyed their fried chicken sausage sandwich and their chicken paprikash poutine (just be aware that they salt everything so if you don't want salt on your fries or cheese curds tell them when you place your order). We also enjoyed their beer and wine selection. 

How was this a hot mess? A random guy sat next to me at the bar and started chatting with me, turns out he is the brother of someone I know. Next up some friendly people from Memphis and Greenhouse Tavern showed up and shared their three bottles of wine with us. Dropping of glasses, beard inquires, harassment of staff, and awkward compliments to other patrons may have then transpired. The kicker was when one of the cooks told me we went on an OkCupid date together about 1 1/2 - 2 years ago. It was not the greatest of dates and once the realization hit me I immediately ran out. 

I will definitely be back because the food was good, the atmosphere friendly, and the other customers a riot, but probably not on a weekend when Jeff is working, well, unless I have my hair and makeup done and I am wearing some sexy number...

The place was packed at 3:30pm, but I think that was because tours started up at the Christmas Story House across the street. Eventually the place cleared out a bit but none of this stopped our group of 5 from having a good time! 

We were seated at the corner of the bar and enjoyed happy hour specials like half price poutine ($3.75) and discounts on draft beers ($4.50). Our server was awesome and we all around had a pretty enjoyable couple hours just talking and laughing. 

So about the food. A couple of us went with the poutine and we were a bit disappointed to find out that they were out of the regular fries and instead we were served seasoned curly fries. Cheese curds were not even in the slightest bit warmed up. But the gravy was very good. My friends said this dish was great in the past so I am going to chalk this experience up to the place being so busy and running out of their typical food stock. 

I did get the The Bumpus Hounds Lunch ($10) to-go. It's basically an open faced turkey sandwich with blue cheese mashed potatoes and gravy on top. It comes with a side so I selected their gouda mac & cheese (+$2) and an extra side of coleslaw ($3) as well. The mac & cheese is freaking delicious! I will have to try it as a entree with chicken mmm. The purple cabbage vinegar based coleslaw was a perfect pairing to cut the fat. Food held up even when refrigerated and reheated.

Once inside I was warmly greeted by the friendly owner whose middle name is Joy. It turned out I was there during happy hour (2-6pm) so I got a dollar off every item I purchased! After sampling many delicious and unique flavors (there was actual chunks of Brie Cheese in one of them!) I decided to get a couple ice cream sandwiches (which if you buy in bulk you get them at a cheaper price). I went with a Bourbon flavored ice cream between two Chocolate Chip cookies, Vegan Cayenne Sweet Potato Pecan sandwiched between two Oatmeal cookies, and Berry Cheesecake between two Sugar Cookies with Sprinkles. 

OMG my mouth was so happy! But dang these babies are huge! It took me a couple sittings before I could finish off just one so I am pretty thankful each one comes in a sealed plastic pouch.

Simple but good cooking hit the spot just right for me and my friends on a Sunday afternoon. The place had just opened for the day and it smelled clean when we walked in. There was a little boy who helped greet people and seat them which I thought was cute and showed this is a family run business. Now on to the food... 

The food here is simple but all of the pairings work so well together. The empanada was a cheesy fried treat well complemented with the side of salsa. The pupusa was plain but the slaw and sauce gave it a boost of flavor.

(I love that they use real mini metal spoons for the tastings as it always makes me sad to see a ton of plastic spoons the trash). While I wasn't ecstatic about the flavors (love that they are homemade with local ingredients) I did find a little piece of heaven in the Philomena Banana Bread dessert. Mmm so good! It's two slices of homemade banana chocolate chip bread that has brown sugar brûléed on one side then it's topped with 3 scoops of ice cream of your choice (I chose just one scoop of banana and one scoop of vanilla) then some whip cream of your choice (I chose nutella) and finally a drizzle of sauce.

- Pierogie burger $4.99. I liked this one so much I did not share. Even ate half of it cold the next day. Nice sized pierogie, onions, good meat to buttery bun ratio.

This place is a bit out of the way for me, we're talking a good 45 minute drive, but I was meeting up with a small group of friends and the food was great so I would definitely make the drive again!

We started off with the burnt ends appetizer $10.50 which was very tasty! Then 3 of us tried out some of the meat and side options (ranges from $13.50 - $25) while one person tried the shrimp and grits plate $17. I really liked that the meat plates include 2 sides and cornbread. Some places the plate doesn't include a side and/or you get a slice of grocery store white bread. 

All I can remember is that I had enough food for three meals and that I really enjoyed everything except the mashed potatoes. Those tasted like old boxed potatoes that had been sitting in a warmer for too long. I took one bite and traded them for a different side. 

Our waiter was a young friendly kid who joked around with our table. All of the staff we encountered were pleasant. This place is located in a plaza, but that just means they have plenty of parking.

Both are huge and cost $2.95 each. Pretty sure the chocolate they use is the European variety so it has more cocoa and less sugar compared to the American kind; to me this makes it a little bitter tasting and so I was not a big fan of the croissant. (The bakery consultant they used was Maurice Chaplais, who is from England). The strawberry danish on the other hand I loved! It was made like a pinwheel and I would slowly pull off layers and dip them into the cream center. Mmm, but definitely a sweet and sticky treat though.

So I've heard about the J Gumbo's located downtown and it's been on my list to try so imagine my excitement when I discovered there's a location down the road from my work! A couple co-workers and I headed on out for lunch. This place is located in the plaza behind Wendy's and the Shell gas station on Rockside road. It's a bit newer as I think it opened up December 2014 so inside is relatively nice with a bar and some neat artwork on the walls (that crab painting has a Van Gogh quality to it). I also liked how they were playing some music by Tab Benoit. The lady at the register was friendly and when we walked in she had just brought out a tray of little samples for the customers in front of us to try. That is awesome! I am always so indecisive so I think it's great when a place let's you try a couple things to help you make up your mind. You can't always just ask about the items because staff will typically say ""Oh everything is good"".

I decided to do a mix and get two entrees in one bowl for $8.95. Half was the Crawfish Étouffée  and the other half the Bourbon Street Chicken (each bowl also comes with a piece of buttered French bread). One thing I need to mention is that when I asked for a cup for water I was given a regular sized cup! Not a tiny plastic baby cup! Thank you!! We were given plastic order number cards and sat down at a high top table where a staff member would bring out our dishes when ready. We didn't wait very long, maybe 5 minutes max. The food looks appealing and they definitely give you a decent sized portion that will fill you up. The flavors were great too. First bite of the thick/mushy étouffée and I was like ""eh"", but it grew on me and I really enjoyed the spiciness of it. Definitely made me drink a lot of water! I found there to be an adequate amount of sauce to cover all of my white rice, and although the crawfish meat was not overly abundant, there were some good chunks of it. The bourbon was on the mild side and had a sweet taste to it which I enjoyed. Lots of chicken in this dish. I think mixing the two really aided in making this meal so great because it then wasn't lacking in sauce or meat like other reviewers mentioned. 

The only minor downside to our experience was that the food came out somewhat lukewarm, so my only suggestion would be to turn up temperature a little bit. Also, this isn't really a complaint, but I did notice we were just about the only women in the place. Lots of men; maybe they are more inclined to eat a heartier lunch than women?

After we were done with our meals, what appeared to be the owner or manager came over and took away our plates, graciously accepted our compliments about the food, and gave us $2 off coupons to share with our other co-workers.

797,ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw,4,"Popped in one evening to grab some take-out for dinner. Staff was friendly. Restaurant was empty, but it was early. I went with the...

*Chicken Tikka Masala $13.95 - Very good! And huge portion. I got 2.5 VERY filling meals out of this. Only note is that I got the mild and I still thought it was a little spicy, I am a weak one though. 
*Garlic Naan $2.95 - Excellent for scooping up my entrée and delivering tastiness to my mouth!
*Mixed Vegetable Platter $9.95 - It was just okay. Order is enough for two people. Slight issue with the samosa but quick response from management resolved things. 

All in all I would go back to try some other items, and I have even more options if I check out their Namaste restaurant.

798,NfIqgh7zrXLh39mRpZO0RQ,4,"Yay! This place has definitely improved since they first opened! Very glad I stopped in recently to give them another try. 

This time I tried the pick four sampler. I was told that normally they don't let you double up on the meats, but my server was kind enough to appease me and let me order ribs, ribs, pulled pork and brisket. The pulled pork and brisket looked to be about a quarter of a pound each and my double order of ribs came out to 4 bones. The meal also included 3 sides of which I chose the baked beans, coleslaw, and mac & cheese. A little loaf of cornbread along with some pickles and onions topped off the sampler platter for $22. I also got the smoked jalapenos at $5. 

Now for the details. I thought the texture of all of the meats was great! The pulled pork and brisket were definitely moist and tender, the rib meat pulled off the bone nicely, and you could see that slight pink smoke ring on all of the meats. Also, nothing was overloaded with fat this time and nothing was dried out either. My only small complaint would be that they are heavy handed with the black pepper. The ribs and brisket had a mushy black pepper crust on them that I actually started to wipe off towards the end. I love black pepper, but I found the amount of this spice to be overwhelming here. The quality of the meat is so good though that I would gladly eat it again, I would just scrape off the crust at the beginning. 

For the sides they come in about 4oz? containers. I could be wrong on the size, but basically they are decent portions, nothing skimpy here. I thought the mac & cheese was cooked perfectly! The right amount of noodle to cheese sauce ratio. The baked beans come with peppers, pineapple, and meat (bits of fat). Kind of a smokey, spicy, sweet flavor, but good. The coleslaw is still not the best, seemed like a mixture between a cream and vinegar sauce with a lot of black pepper. Edible, but I have had better. The loaf of cornbread has improved a million times compared to that dried out little muffin they first served. Not sweet or gritty, but still pretty good. The texture was dense and moist. 

The smoked jalapenos were good, nothing outstanding, but good. They are peppers stuffed with a creamy cheese mixture then topped with smoked bacon. A nice accompaniment to your meal. 

Overall I think Woodstock does pretty well with the things that matter most to me in regards to BBQ (quality of meat, mac & cheese, and cornbread). I also think that the price is affordable and I got two hearty meals out of my sampler platter. They now rank towards the top of my BBQ list and I would gladly try them out again.",2637,0.0,0.08053768427447891,0.0,0.11855218444020348,0.0,0.8009101312853176,"place,try,time,sampler,meats,server,ribs,pork,brisket,quarter,pound,order,bones,meal,sides,beans,coleslaw,mac,cheese,loaf,cornbread,pickles,onions,platter,jalapenos,details,texture,tender,rib,meat,bone,smoke,ring,nothing,fat,complaint,pepper,crust,end,amount,spice,quality,beginning,oz,containers,size,portions,noodle,sauce,ratio,peppers,pineapple,bits,smokey,flavor,mixture,cream,vinegar,lot,times,muffin,moist,bacon,accompaniment,things,regards,price,meals,top,bbq,list","meal,meat,quality,meals","time,order,end,quality,beginning,times"
799,A7gK6ZrGy939Zo43xNZcVw,5,"I see some Yelper's are not feeling the love for Forage, but that's okay, this is why I highly suggest people read a couple of reviews to get a mix of opinion before they decide to check a place out or not. Everyone has different tastes and different experiences. I went with a group of eight and I personally really enjoyed what Forage had to offer!

Forage is in the old Pacers space on the first level of the tall Lakewood Center North building. You can catch free parking after 6pm along the street or in a lot next door. The decor is simple, clean, and they have a gas (or fake) fireplace in one corner that looks cozy. I had reservations so there was no wait (but it was a week night so you could definitely just walk in and get a table no problem). No issues with service - I thought it was pretty standard, they gave us space to enjoy our meal and chat, but it's not like we had to flag them down for everything either. 

For the food I did get to sample a couple of appetizers:
-Farmer Lee Jones Beets $13 - One guest really liked this dish. I thought it was okay, could have used some pepper to season it and some more feta. 
-Poutine $10 - Came in a big bowl so plenty to share. I did like that they were fresh cut fries and they used cheese curds (instead of cheapening the dish with shredded cheese), but I thought it could have used more gravy (you're supposed to eat this with a knife and fork, not your fingers).
-Devils on Horseback $9 - Simply delicious! Only three in an order, but really tasty and big enough that you can't pop a whole one in your mouth. Definitely spurge and get this!
-Daily Oysters on the Half Shell $? - First time trying. Not a bad taste... more of a weird texture. Not my thing. 
-Stuffed Pasture Raised Eggs $9 - This was another really tasty item with six in an order. I tend to stay away from deviled eggs because I think they'd just be simple and bland, but these were so creamy and mmm good. 

For main dishes:
-I got the Open Faced BBQ Pork at $13 and really enjoyed it! I was happy to see it wasn't a tiny portion, but instead nicely sized so you don't miss not having a side and you can share a couple bites with others. I'm a firm believer that shredded pork tastes better with a crunchy slaw and this did not disappoint as it also had crispy onions on it. The pork had some sweetness to it and the cornbread was slightly moist. I'd get this again for sure. 
-Ohio Beef Burger $9 for plain - One guest said they had this in the past and it was one of the best burgers they'e had. Just watch out for all of the additional charges for each topping you add. 
-Bahn Mi $10 - I only had a small bite of this, and honestly I don't remember too much about it besides that it smelled good and that you'd have to have a secure set of teeth to rip the bread. It comes with kettle chips, but you can upgrade to pommes frites with garlic, rosemary and aioli. (Love me some aioli!).
-Rainbow Trout $17 - Two guests got this and the overall opinion seemed to be that it was okay, but a little lackluster. 

Two guests did get dessert: Single Origin Belgian Chocolate Creme $9, and they both seemed to really enjoy it. I was just way too stuffed for dessert, but I will definitely be back to try some! 

Their craft beer menu is not that impressive, but hey, they still had some and I was there to eat not be a snob about my drinks. 

To sum it up, I think Forage has some really great dishes that your taste buds will enjoy, but like every restaurant, they are going to have some ""just okay"" dishes as well. Perhaps I lucked out with my choices. I think going out with a pleasant enjoyable group of people also has an impact on your dining experience. I really have nothing that bad to say that would cause me to give this place lower stars. It is a little pricey, but still affordable depending on what you choose and the portions are decently sized. Besides, I don't know about you, but I'd rather pay a little more for a place that buys their goods locally and tries to make everything in house instead of getting everything pre-made, in cans or frozen.",4094,0.15754579735578392,0.007729751378467597,0.0,0.2032418591152822,0.1413372333064382,0.4901453588440281,"yelper,love,people,couple,reviews,mix,opinion,place,everyone,tastes,experiences,group,forage,space,level,building,parking,pm,street,lot,door,decor,gas,corner,reservations,wait,week,night,table,problem,issues,service,meal,chat,everything,food,appetizers,guest,dish,pepper,bowl,cut,fries,cheese,curds,gravy,knife,fork,fingers,-devils,order,one,mouth,oysters,time,taste,texture,thing,item,eggs,dishes,-i,portion,side,bites,others,believer,pork,crunchy,slaw,crispy,onions,sweetness,cornbread,beef,past,burgers,charges,bite,set,teeth,bread,kettle,chips,frites,aioli,guests,dessert,craft,beer,menu,snob,drinks,buds,restaurant,choices,impact,dining,experience,nothing,stars,portions,goods,house,cans","meal,food,beef,bread,drinks,goods","space,level,building,week,service,order,one,time,others,experience"
800,epAifIGqwj5oFp5MV8kgiQ,5,"Listen, I've only been here once, but it was effing delicious! We were at the art museum checking out Monet when one of my friends was getting super hangry (so hungry they turned cranky), so we finished up at the art museum and headed to Little Italy to give them the food coma they deserved. 

It was late Saturday afternoon so we were lucky to snag a parking spot on the street right outside the restaurant. Once inside we were greeted by warm and friendly staff and seated right away. We started off with some warm bread with herb butter then worked on appetizers of  pork belly ($11) and sauteed calamari. Both were presented beautifully and were full of flavor. For a main dish I got the special of fettuccine carbonara ($19) with cheese sprinkled on top - oh my lord so creamy and fresh my mouth was in heaven! A huge portion as well! I only ate half before I asked for a to-go container and you better believe I boxed that meal up myself so I could use the bread to soak up any remaining sauce on the plate. 

My dining companions enjoyed mimosas, espressos, and tiramisu which they all said they enjoyed. I had a bite (really like 4 bites) of the homemade tiramisu which was super tasty which I thought was surprising since I don't like coffee, but I would definitely order this next time!

I really have no complaints, just sad that when I reheated the pasta the sauce separated into this pool of oil, but that's what you get for using the microwave I guess.

They have some patio seating outside, but it was too cold for that. Inside we sat at a high top table and enjoyed a couple beers and a nice late lunch.

805,ZLVWlYQQxzZoJbg4w0gsMA,4,"Came here with a group of nine on a Thursday. They don't accept reservations, but if you have a large group then you're allowed to call ahead 30 minutes and they will start to think about where to put you. Downside is that even if they have a table ready for you, you're not allowed to be seated until your entire party is there. This is kind of a bad business practice as one in our group had a cast on her foot and was forced to stand in the doorway dodging other patrons until they caved and let us sit down at our table with six of our party there. To be fair to the few that were late, the parking get's filled up fast in the Old River Shopping area and you'll have to circle around a couple times or do like I did and park down the road and walk a little ways to the restaurant. 

For the food I got the July burger of the month, I think it was called 3 pigs or something? It had pulled pork, pork belly, ? and coleslaw on it. Although the burger patty seemed a little plain and lacked seasoning, overall the sandwich was good and big enough to share. The burgers are priced at $7.50 for plain and up to $16 for a bison burger with most burgers falling around the $10 mark. The burgers don't come with anything so you'll be set back an additional $4.50-$6.50 for a side of fries or onion rings, but the portions are enough for two. I opted for the sweet potato fries with a horseradish mustard sauce and they were pretty tasty. My dining companions all seemed to enjoy the various burgers they got and we passed around the sides. The onion rings are huge, but I didn't really care for them, they seemed bland. The chili cheese fries were tasty. The truffle fries were okay, but a little too herby and oily for me. Our waitress was pleasant and informative (even showed me a picture of the July burger special on her phone) and I liked the décor (they have those garage door windows that can be pulled up in the summer), only thing is it is really loud in there and it was hard to hear the people at my table talking.

I've been back for the one red door burger and the mac & cheese with BBQ brisket. The mac & cheese came in at $9.50 and looks a little plain and like it is lacking sauce but don't be fooled, I found it to be pretty good. Again with the burger I wasn't that impressed with the meat, but it was good overall. My sweet potato fries were a little well done and salty, but I ate them. 

Overall I'd say FlipSide is on the same level as The Rail, Heck's, Jammy Buggars or B-Spot. They all serve a ""higher-end"" version of the burger with alcohol in the milkshakes and aioli dipping sauces. I'd hit up this place again.

806,sfa7IPru2FRBaf7LX-lWqA,4,"Stopped in a Sunday evening to get a sampling of BBQ to enjoy the next couple of days (I ate this for 3 days!). The parking lot was packed, but my wait was super short. I think the longest part was me deciding what to get. Young lady at the register was friendly and patient. The woman who gave me my order was friendly and opened up all of the boxes to explain what they were and make sure everything was in there. She also gave me samples of all of their sauces. 

-Brisket Sandwich $8.29. Lots of meat! I'd guess half a pound? Meat was chopped up, moist and tender, kinda made me think I was eating pot roast, but it was really good. I would get this again! 
-Pulled Pork Pick Two Meat Sampler $8.99. Good. Moist. 1/4lbs or 4oz
-Pulled Chicken Pick Two Meat Sampler $8.99. Good. Moist. 1/4lbs or 4oz
-Baby Back Ribs $2.39 each bone. Ordered two bones and received a bigger portion size than expected. Meat was moist and definitely fell off the bone, but to me that is over cooked. Rib meat should easily pull off the bone, not fall into pieces as you try to pick up a rib. Also, to me this tasted extremely salty. Like I was shocked at how salty the meat was. 
-Spare Ribs $2.19 each bone. Ordered two bones and received a bigger portion size than expected. Meat was firmer than the baby back ribs and while still a little salty, not as as bad as the baby backs. 
-Baked Beans with Brisket $2.04. A-Okay, but the first night I munched on this it tasted really fatty to me. Next day it was fine so IDK what was up with that. 
-Coleslaw $1.89. Much needed light and refreshing side. Nothing special, but satisfying. 
-Cheesy Potatoes $2.14. Just added some black pepper and it was freaking delicious! Very hearty so it helped to split it and not eat it all in one sitting. 
-Mac & Cheese $2.09. Good, but does lean towards the mac & cheese you find in a crockpot at a family get together. Again, not bad at all, not dried out or anything, I just prefer a creamy cheese sauce. Still a nice comfort food side.
-Cornbread 79¢. Satisfying portion size. Texture is perfect, moist with a couple whole kernels inside. I just like my cornbread with a little more buttery/sweet flavor. Could picture breaking this up over a bowl of chili and enjoying. 
-Sauces. They have 6 flavors and you can find, sweet, spicy, smokey, vinegary varieties. I personally could not pick one that really did it for my taste buds, but none of them were bad at all. I think I was just overwhelmed, might be better to get just two at time. 

Very nice to find they don't skimp on sides and that the sizes are about a cup. Ordered one slice of cornbread, but got three in my order so I was a little confused if cornbread came with any of the meals or they just threw extras in there. Pleasantly surprised by the meat portions and that all of the meat was moist. Also think the pricing is reasonable and appropriate. 

For just opening I think they have done a good job (probably due to their experience since this is a chain). All in all, I think this is a solid chain place, really enjoyed some things and thought other things were just okay.

807,iMGGM-WVNKep9c6bgRYjpA,4,"My first experience with Naf Naf was a little odd due to a self-centered older man who twice let doors start to shut in my face even though he saw I was two steps behind him. Once inside he cut people and went straight to the front end of the line where he proceeded to confuse everyone by trying to pay for and take someone else's order. The poor guy he was hijacking had to have his order remade and wait awkwardly while a group of employees tried to figure out what happened. The old guy was led back to the start of the line. You can't teach manners, but maybe a sign that says ""Start here"" would be helpful. 

No issues with staff. Interior is clean. Parking in front or back. Prices range from $6.50 for a falafel pita to $11.75 for a steak shawarma combo with fries and a drink. 

*Veggie Feast $8.95 - Sooo good! I would definitely get this again! 4 crispy tasty falafels with hummus, chopped tomato and cucumber salad, purple cabbage, sumac onions (very potent), and baba ghanoush plus a fluffy side of pita bread which was soft and perfect to scoop up my dips with. 
*Chicken Shawarma Bowl $8.20 - Also comes with a fluffy pita. Not a bad salad at all, you can choose between rice, lettuce or hummus, then meat, some veggies and dressing (mmm garlic sauce). 
*Fries $2.75 - Not fries, more like half crispy half limpy homemade chips. Only one size. Maybe would be better if they had some Middle Eastern seasoning you could sprinkle on top? Mediocre, would probably not waste the calories on them again. 
*Baklava $1.60 - At first bite I was like ""what is this, watered down syrup?"", but then there was this faint flower taste. DAMN ROSE WATER! Get out of here rose water! No one really likes you! Would not get again because I don't like perfume flavored food.

808,B6nhGEqt6rzXw6TwltTspA,4,"Showed up on a Thursday evening with a group of about nine. The Indians were playing that night but I had no trouble finding a free spot along Euclid not far from the restaurant. The place had a constant stream of customers, but it was not too busy inside and we were able to put together three tables for our group. Also found no issue with the cleanliness or decor, and I would like to mention that although the music was a little older, it was nice to know all of the words and a couple guests were even bopping along to the music in their seats. 

Staff was friendly and informative when I asked about the ingredients and which pizza's they favored. Turns out they get their veggies from a local source and I even saw someone get a whole basil plant from the back! You start out with about a 12 inch pizza dough (I'm guessing here) and you can either select a house specialty or choose from a variety of toppings to create your own. It's also neat that you can see them build the pizza right in front of you so you can ask for a little more or less of something as they are putting your toppings on. Next up they place your pie in a special Italian fire oven where it bakes for about 3 minutes and comes out hot with a couple specks of black but definitely not burnt. 

I went with The Buffalo pizza and it was definitely cheesy with a good amount of buffalo chicken shredded on it. I thought it was pretty tasty! There was about 1  1/2 - 2 inches of plain flat crust which I am not always a fan of, but you could easily get a side of sauce to dip it in if you don't want to throw the crust away. The pizza is cut into six slices so you could share it or eat it all yourself without too much guilt since it is thin. Others at my table got The New York and The Hollywood pizza and both of them looked pretty tasty as well. One person said their Margherita pizza had way too much sea salt on it so if you get that one maybe ask for less salt when they make it. 

Overall I'd recommend this place for a fast and simple bite to eat if you're downtown AND it's also pretty affordable at about $8 a pizza. They offer salads and big cookies too if you want to balance out your meal :) A little side note: the owner of Pizza Fire also founded Romeo's Pizza so it's no surprise they are busting out other locations right away.

I highly suggest people check this place out, just be warned that after 6:30pm  this place is going to fill up fast and get loud. (At least on a Friday night)

A friend and I split the nachos mentioned above, guac with goat cheese, Al Pastor Taquitos, and a side of refried beans. The portions were big enough to share and there was a little leftover to take home. My only complaint would be that for $14 the taquito entree should have included the side instead of having to pay extra for it.

810,9LAXz_VfATZ0kLdaavkN4g,4,"Listen, imma gonna give it to you straight. I just walked out of Bakersfield looking like a happy, sweaty, pregnant walrus and I have no regrets. Stuffed AF ya'll.

Disclaimer: I've had two of their alcoholic beverages and they are deceptively strong. Like ""Ooohh yeah this pineapple margarita ($10) is amazing! I can't even taste the liquor! Bring me one of those pretty sangria's! ($9)"" And the next thing you know you're being feisty and harassing the wait staff again. Whatevs, they liked it. At least that's what my lawyer is going to argue...

Sorry, I got off track, let me start at the beginning. We had our monthly supper club here tonight. I was not allowed to reserve a table so a couple of us showed up early to snag seating for 15. (Apparently there were 3 others in our group but we got separated in the crowded room. I think they might have been the three ballerina's at one of the standing tables. If that was you I'm so sorry! I didn't check my messages until it was all over! I have failed as a host.)

Anyways, we were served by Matt (aka Chewy) and Brandon. Both did an excellent job with our big group. Pleasant and attentive. We also had the manager Joe (aka Haley Joel Osment) wandering about us like a homeless person ready to pounce at any taco left behind. Just kidding, he was nice and just making sure everything was going okay. (It was his first day). Oh and this reminds me, Joe and Mr. General Manager Neil are some tasty looking eye candy. Meow, come here and sit on this spinster cat lady's lap! 

Alright, now that I'm banned from Bakersfield, let me wrap up this review. I think most of us partook in the make your mama holler special (I just made that name up) where groups of 6 or more are allowed to get shareable appetizers (chips, chunky guac, salsa, cheese dip), the most delicious salad, and a variety of tacos for just $15 each! And it was served endless style, like they loaded us up! ""Oh you need more tacos? No problem! Let me get you taken care of, sexy lady"". Okay, they didn't really say sexy lady, but I'm 31 years old currently sitting in the shower, alone, while I write this so I'm gonna dream damn it!

I'd say the food and drinks were pretty tasty. Drinks are a bit pricey, but they made me happy so I'm gonna make it rain (as in, take all my money for those not up on the cool kid slang). Service was awesome, decor was western industrial?, definitely had a trendy but laid-back vibe to it. My only complaint would be that it did not appear their A/C was working. This was bad because it was 70° out and raining and they had the windows and doors open so it was super humid and warm inside. Like I'm an extra juicy babe, ya'll can't be subjecting me to those conditions unless you want to personally wipe the sweat off my body. 

Okay, I'm probably gonna regret this review in the morning, but YOLO. Actually I already regret that stupid saying. I'm done. Time to watch Golden Girls.




**Update: Upon some reflection I had to dock a star for the whole hot and sweaty situation. Several members of our group complained about it and I know I felt really gross and immediately hopped in the shower when I got home. You should be using the A/C on hot and rainy days, don't be leaving those doors open and letting the humidity in, especially with it being crowded inside. If there is an issue with the A/C get it fixed ASAP cause summer is a comin'! They just opened two weeks ago so hopefully this was just a fluke. But you should definitely still check them out!

813,h2Gc7ZP0LN6VZWqIRYtCEA,4,"I've actually been to Thailand so when I was having a craving for some authentic Thai food I was happy to find out there was a new restaurant in town with glowing reviews! I stopped in one evening to try a few things:

Massaman Curry: A mild sweet curry with a hint of cinnamon and nutmeg - one of my favorite curries! 
Pad Thai: They let me get this with pork and while the pork had some fatty bits to it, I still enjoyed this meal. Simple yet full of flavor. 
Som Tum Thai: Green papaya salad that was way too spicy for me. But I am sure they can tone that down if you ask. 

The woman who took my order was friendly and said she is originally from Bangkok. No bells and whistles inside, very simple with what looked like a little Thai shrine in the back to appease the spirits and some colorful framed photos for decoration. I would go here again!


**Authentic defined: ""made or done in the traditional or original way, or in a way that faithfully resembles an original"". When speaking about authentic food, even though there can be variations of a dish in its place of origin, most would agree that there are staple ingredients that follow the original recipe - like fish sauce, tamarind, palm sugar, lime wedges, rice noodles, red pepper, powdered dried shrimp, and often peanuts for pad Thai. So when you've had this dish several times in Thailand you come to expect certain smells, textures, and a balance of certain flavors, because really, this dish is not that varied in taste beside different veggies and meats added to it. Finding that back in the US (or something very close to it) is pretty great and would be considered an authentic dish since it closely resembles the way that dish is generally prepared in Thailand. 

Another example would be slapping tomatoes and pickles on a hot dog and calling it Chicago style. Nope. Some dishes have standards and hearing a place is authentic gives a person a better idea of what to expect if they have had the original, the real deal, the dish that started it all.",2022,0.0,5.9915307075147704e-05,0.0,0.0,0.25870093702578306,0.7412391476671418,"craving,food,restaurant,town,reviews,evening,things,curry,hint,cinnamon,curries,pork,bits,meal,flavor,salad,woman,order,bells,whistles,shrine,back,spirits,photos,decoration,way,variations,dish,place,origin,ingredients,recipe,fish,sauce,tamarind,palm,sugar,lime,wedges,rice,noodles,pepper,shrimp,peanuts,pad,times,smells,textures,balance,flavors,taste,veggies,meats,something,example,tomatoes,pickles,dog,style,dishes,standards,person,idea,deal","food,meal,ingredients,fish,sugar,rice","evening,order,way,times,example,standards"
814,vv9H_J72uCKyWaWkn0N-8Q,4,"It took a solid 5 months, but I finally went back to Barabicu and have decide to upgrade them to 4 stars. My first review is pretty detailed so this update is going to be simple. 

Pros
-Staff is still very pleasant.
-Sizes of the sides have increased and you can upgrade to medium or large sides now. 
-Nice portion sizes in general. You could split food or stuff yourself until it hurts. 
-Coleslaw and baked beans still good. 
-Pulled pork and sauces still good. (I actually sprinkled some of the pork on top of a cheese pizza to give it something extra).
-Chicken cupcake was a slightly moist and tasty hunk of meat that I enjoyed dipped in either sauce.  
-They added plastic tables and chairs for seating in the side room. 
-Ribs still lean more towards firm than juicy, but I had no problem tearing the meat off the bone this time. 

Slight Cons
-Still don't like that mac & cheese. I know they changed it up with some spices and now it's a weird brownish orange color, but meh for the taste. 
-They get their bread from the grocery store when they can't go to a local bakery. I'd prefer it if they made their own cornbread or stuck with ordering from local bakeries but it is what it is. 
-No desserts that I saw. (What about a bacon cookie? Pie?)
-They don't offer pickles or onions with the meat like some other BBQ places do. I think it adds to the taste but really not a big deal. 
-They seem to always have smokehouse meatloaf on special, but rarely anything else. Where is that egg salad with bacon and chimichurri sauce you had when you first opened? Unique specials pique my interest. 


Overall I would say good job! Not the best I have ever had like some of these glowing 5 star reviews claim, but pretty good and they seem to be fine competitors with the ten or so other BBQ places that have opened up around town (add Hatfield's and Brooklyn BBQ to my prior list). Actually I'd say they were better than a couple of them. It really depends on what kind of BBQ you like (rubs vs sauced, drier vs juicy), also how important are sides to you? Some places have great sides but lackluster meat or vice versa.

815,m9eF1rD6Cnwn69z45_cBLA,5,"Sweet baby Jesus this place is good! I'm often skeptical if a business only has glowing 5 star reviews, but this place is legit and their praise is well deserved!

Outside is nondescript, heck even the inside is nothing special, but oh do they make up for it in food and personality! The front is like a little convenience store and the back is where the deli counter is at. Just let them know you're new and they will quickly make up a little sampler platter for you and they make sure to explain what is on everything while they do it. You'll get some bits of shaved corned beef; turkey with house sauce (kind of like a creamy Italian dressing); pastrami with garlic sauce (amazing garlic sauce!), cheese, and thin pickles slices; and their famous reuben. I took my little sampling to a high top table and savored the gloriousness that was happening in my mouth. 

While there the owner with his legit moustache made some friendly conversation with me. Right away you can tell that this guy is genuine good soul and passionate about his food. He was like ""you break bread here, you are like family now!"" ""I'm so honored to have you come and try our food"". He even called me sweetie, but in like in the nice old guy way, not the condescending creepy guy kind of way. He talked about how him and his wife are Lebanese and how they met in Michigan and went to Cleveland State, he spoke fondly of his son who wants to take over the family business, and what a smart family too! Degrees in business, math, engineering, (I forget what degrees, but they were definitely the kind the smart kids get).

I decided to go with the reuben $8. They make it on pita or white bread and boy this thing is huge! I also got a side of coleslaw $2. They let me sample some of their chicken and freshly made hummus too. The latter was warm and tasted amazing. Oh man, and they make reuben mac & cheese! They were out of it when I was there, but the owner was like ""you just call and I make it for you, no problem"". He said they usually have it in the colder months. 

Shout out to the lady at the deli counter, she was personable too. Everyone who works at this place is family. I like it.

All of the staff were patient while I took my time trying to decide what to order and they were friendly as well, even offering up all of their soup selections for me to sample. For $8.25 I was able to get a lunch combo meal consisting of 8oz of soup with a bread roll, and half a sandwich. I opted for the Turkey Club and the Chicken Pot Pie soup, both were enjoyable and very filling. And by filling I mean I just had to undo my belt and my eyes want to close for nap time. 

A co-worker got half a salad with their combo and it was still a nice size and looked tasty. I would probably go for that next time since I over did it on the carbs on my first visit and now my food baby is definitely showing.

818,Jd9L7pNhC982XeCNbPncXg,5,"Stopped here on a Saturday around noon and loved it! My friend and I found spots at the bar where we enjoyed a relaxed atmosphere, tasty food and drink, and excellent service from bartender Megan!

They have a patio for the sunny Ohio days, inside felt pretty open with your choice of tables or bar seating, and if you wanted something a little cozier/away from the crowd there is a loft just up some stairs. You can pick songs from one of those jukebox things and/or watch some sports on their various televisions. You can even take a stroll all around the building and find some sweet street art (that truck is hauling a hop not an artichoke like I first thought FYI). They even have a cool mural of this wild beer king on the inside of their back garage door. 

For beer I sampled six of their offerings in a flight $9 and my favorite was Punchline (fruit ale). My friend preferred their Anchorman (hoppy steam beer). For food we split a small Poutine Pizza $13. Now this small is more like a medium with 8 slices and it definitely left us feeling stuffed. It was very tasty! I know they describe their pizzas as New Haven Style, no idea what that is, but to me the pizzas were thin and full of sauce and toppings. I hate those wood fired pizzas where the crust is burnt and it's dry with very little toppings so I thought Saucy Brew Works did a wonderful job! I can't wait to try more of their pizzas mmm. 

This place is one of those self-serve breweries, so if you want to order something you have to go the designated ordering stations (one for beer, one for food), wait in line, fill out a form, grab your plates and utensils, and wait until they text your phone saying your order is ready.

820,as_fyujgsdwtV56n31z-Sw,4,"I'm a fan of their sister restaurant, (Paladar in Woodmere), so the news that they were opening up a taco place in RR got me excited! I came in around 5:30pm on a Saturday, (their second day open), and this place was packed! It was a little crazy inside but that is to be expected and management seemed to be on top of it. The staff I encountered were actually seasoned workers from Paladar so that probably helps a lot with making the opening of Bomba as smooth as possible. I heard a hostess say something about an hour long wait so I decided to just snag a spot at the bar and order some food to-go. My wait was about 30 minutes, but it wasn't bad as I made some small talk with the friendly older gentleman next to me who was enjoying his beer. (I do regret not ordering a mojito while I was waiting though, those things are so good!) 

Now for the food! 
-Traditional Guac $5.50: Pretty simple but I love that it comes with a mix of yucca, plantain,malanga and corn chips.
-BBQ Duck Tostones $9.50: These are really tasty, but damn that price for only 3.  
-Tacos: Crispy Fish, Roasted Pork Al Pastor, Chorizo & Potato $3 each: I got these on the flour tortillas and thought they were all pretty tasty. 

If you want to liven up the traditional guac you can, but the additional ingredients will cost you .50-$1 each. They have 19 taco options for you to choose from with each taco costing $3-$4 and a recommendation that you get 3-4 per person. It would be great if they had a discounted taco hour or taco night. Sides are $3.50 each and are things like coconut mango rice, black bean soup, salvadorian slaw, or adobo fries.

821,cX2Nr_XmGYlMaBW35M0sUg,4,"We stopped in a little after noon on on Saturday. This place was busy but we did not have a wait. A bit hot inside, all of the staff were noticeably sweating and it took us a little time to cool down. Everyone was very friendly and attentive. Seemed like a pretty well run business. Seating wise it was mostly community seating (everyone at one big table), but that just allowed for us to make a little small chat with our neighbors if we wanted to. 

As for the food we split the 1/2lb of fatty brisket $13, 1/2lb of pork belly $14, cucumber salad $6, and the hot greens $6. The food came out pretty fast. At first glance we thought the portions seemed small and that we would be hungry soon after our meal, but that was not so. Our bellies ended up full but comfortable. As for the food itself, I thought it was some of the best meat I have ever had! Like melt in your mouth good. There is only one sauce and it was vinegar based, but that totally worked well with the meat, especially the pork belly since the vinegar cut the fat. I also really enjoyed the cucumber salad as it was light and refreshing with a nice dill flavor. Hot greens were okay, my dining companion really enjoyed them. We did not eat the slices of white bread, but they seemed to be of the bakery kind and not from a grocery store. Pickles were way too hot, like my mouth was on fire after eating one.

822,w1rHHt72BON3K_C4caDDXw,4,"Yes I am a fan of this place! It's located right off of I-176 so it's easy to get to. The inside has the typical Central America restaurant decor with lively colors, landscape paintings, and birds. When I first walked in there was no one to greet me but a gentleman quickly showed up and we had a pleasant conversation about the menu. I went with a variety of pupusas at $2 each since that is what this place is known for. I also opted for the sweet plantains, refried beans, and homemade sour cream platter which came in at $6. (Prices are great here!)

Pupusas are like a stuffed pancake but made with masa - a corn dough. The garlic and cheese pupusa smells amazing and the Revuelta with pork, beans and cheese is the most popular pupusa, but they have other flavors with chicken, exotic flower, jalapeno, spinach or zucchini. The pupusas come with a simple but tasty cabbage slaw (no mayo base here) and a thin tomato sauce. They're about 5 inches in diameter and two are enough of a meal to fill you up; A simple tasty meal!

I found the fried plantains, refried beans, and homemade sour cream to all be pretty tasty as well. I can't stress enough how good simple authentic Salvadoran food is! I will definitely hit this place up again, probably on a Wednesday though since that's when they make their special sweet corn Atol.",1331,0.0,0.008417589692666889,0.04917830057604255,0.014918066896985391,0.20026416442265074,0.7272218784116544,"fan,place,inside,restaurant,decor,colors,landscape,paintings,birds,one,gentleman,conversation,menu,variety,pupusas,plantains,beans,cream,platter,prices,pancake,masa,corn,dough,garlic,cheese,pupusa,pork,flavors,chicken,flower,jalapeno,spinach,zucchini,cabbage,slaw,mayo,base,tomato,sauce,inches,diameter,meal,food","variety,prices,chicken,meal,food",one

The inside is small with a bar running down one side and tables down the other. They also have a nice patio area.  Right now Rocky River has the whole street torn up which detracts from the ambiance but i'd say their outside seating area is very pleasant regardless of the construction around it.

Their menu is limited but everything I've had has been good. The onion soup and stuffed dates are both very decadent. If you like duck and figs, the duck tartine is a very tasty. Also they have this one cocktail called the Lemon Ginger Sour that I dream about. This place has an upscale bistro vibe but is still very comfortable; the waitstaff is friendly and attentive but has never been pushy or tried to rush us.

The seating area is pretty small; I think a lot of their business is takeout.

Plus  I could eat the asparagus or greek salad every day - their homemade dressings are to die for.

Since it was a Sunday, eating options were slightly limited in the area if you were trying to avoid chains. As I was being shown around parts of the city, we stumbled upon Touch. The people I was with gave rave reviews, so of course I had to try it.

It was their Sunday Brunch - and the place had a really cool vibe. Full bar, high tables, great decor. First off, I ordered the Bloody Mary Bar, which had all the essentials and quite a few additions. I was thoroughly impressed. And the price was just right.

For food, I had the Veggie Omelet which was chalked full of spinach, tomatoes, onions, peppers, cheese.....YUM! It was a hefty size too, as I couldn't finish it. And the 'tots that came with it were the perfect crunch and seasoning. The other folks had the french toast (which was wolfed down) and I'm told was AMAZING with the cream cheese. And the other had some blueberry pancakes, I believe.... which he really enjoyed, as well.

What was also really nice, was that we got fruit bowls for appetizers w/ the brunch. A nice touch!

The bathrooms were very neat. There are two, single bathrooms that have nifty ""Vacant"" style locks on the outside. Sticking true to the decor.

We try to select non-big occasion, destination-type places, rather good food, locally owned even hole-in-the-wall places. Our choice this month was The Oak Barrel. We were all happily surprised.  I called in early afternoon to try to get a reservation, but was told they didn't accept them.  However, the very friendly and helpful hostess told me she'd put us on the ""call list,"" for a 7:30 arrival.  And, true to her word when we arrived, she seated us in the bar area immediately.

Began with last night's special salad, roasted Ohio grown yellow and red beets with goat cheese, pistachios, and a balsamic reduction.   Two of us ordered it and agreed it was fantastic!  The beets were perfectly done, still firm, not mushy as is so often the case. I could be very happy having a slightly larger portion as a main dish--it was that tasty.  We ordered four different entrees, and everyone was very happy with their choice. Two were from the menu...roast pork tenderloin and angel hair pasta..and the others were nightly specials.  My friend ordered the Ohio City Pasta ravioli stuffed with ricotta and asparagus, which she absolutely loved, and I opted for the pan seared scallops over wild mushroom risotto finished with lemon beurre blanc.  They were sweet, tender and perfectly done.  The risotto was tasty and the sauce a perfect compliment. My only complaint was the scallops were crusted with way too much peppercorn.  The crust totally overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the scallops. Once I scraped the crusts off, the scallops were delicious!  My only other, admittedly minor, complaint was my Lemon Drop martini was so tart (sour actually) that it wasn't really enjoyable. Switched to a vodka and tonic.

The meal is not on the menu and when I was here there were about 4 tables of patrons with 3 or less in the party. My group was the biggest at 10.

Everything was great! Each course had 3 options for a drink pairing and every person in the room basically got their food and drinks at the same time. This to me made the experience very communal even with people you didn't know. 

Also, the main entree was turkey and they accommodated my veggie life style by giving my a hefty plate of all the delicious veggies.

They are tucked away in the back corner of the flats and have a free parking lot, great view of the lake, and cool relaxed ambience.

I definitely recommend trying one of their tasting nights.",886,0.2854637156897589,0.0,0.328719644186861,0.0,0.0,0.38581664012338,"disclaimer,review,nights,public,set,price,course,meal,drink,pairings,menu,tables,patrons,party,group,everything,options,pairing,person,room,food,time,experience,people,entree,turkey,life,style,plate,veggies,corner,flats,parking,lot,view,lake,ambience","meal,drink,food","public,time,experience"

Eric is a good brewer with imagination. The narrator's voice of the beer menu is kinda weird, allegedly preferring few words, yet offering decent descriptions of the beers. There's good stuff going on here, I wish it was a bit cheaper, but I don't feel ripped off for what you get. The flights are way overpriced though.

I met the Butcher (or is it just ""butcher""? why no definite article for THE butcher?), Rex, who seems like a knowledgeable good dude who is doing great things with sourcing their meats from quality farms and using whole animals. Cool.

The food from the restaurant is nice. However, small plates are the worst. They're $7-12 and you have to order 3 to not walk out hungry. Too much money. Too little food. Restaurants should stop pretending small plates are cool. They're just a way to rip off the diner. Boo.

977,JezHN-9KKLTMbojq00VP0g,5,"I think this is my favorite restaurant in all of Cleveland! Every time I've been it's been delightful. So many aspects of this place are really swell, every time. 

The interior is charming, with the smaller open kitchen in the original little triangle shaped cafe. It's cramped in a really charming way that doesn't feel claustrophobic. There's always music playing throughout the whole restaurant that seems just right for the atmosphere - laid back, fun, intimate. It's not immaculate - the steps down to the clean bathrooms could use repainting, the wood edges of walls and tables are clearly well loved.

It seems like servers stick around at Le Petit, I've seen several of the same faces there for a couple of years - they've been friendly and helpful every time.

When I look at the menu I usually get worried that I'm going to come away hungry, but I never do - even when there aren't any  accompaniments listed, there usually are.
I don't know how to say things on the menu, but I most recently had an egg dipped veggie sandwich with small potatoes on the side, all of which was flavorful and well cooked.

Cheap is what I like. While Le Petit is not bargain basement price, their prices are very fair given the quality of food. I could imagine them charging double what they do and getting away with it - thank goodness they don't!
